# NoFuture.Antlr
---
You can re-generate any of the *.cs files by invoking the included 
GetAntlrCodeFiles.ps1 from within Powershell.  Each project has its
own and is expected to be invoked from that location.

### Example
```powershell
C:\> Push-Location C:\Projects\31g\trunk\Code\NoFuture\Antlr\HTML
C:\> . .\GetAntlrCodeFiles.ps1
```
