  - shortcut settings
  - command palette layout
  - unit settings (e.g. inches, pixels)

 - Icon: a simple graphic to represent some kind of command or property

    sub-tool 
    - the user can add\remove any of these

 - Sub Tool Detail: a pop-up window (palette) for _all_ the properties 
    of a sub-tool.
    - the Tool Property palette is some sub-set of these

 - Eraser: a tool which removes content from layer(s)
  - Hard Eraser: pressure-sensitive hard-edge eraser where erased area 
     increases as the pressure rises
  - Soft Eraser: same as above on having a soft edge
  - Multiple layers Eraser: based on the selected layer, all content
     from there down is erased
   
 - Ruler: a tool used to easily match the perspective rules of 
    visual reality (e.g. vanishing points, ellipses, symmetry, tessellation, etc.)

 - Materials: a name for the taxonomic catalog of the various textures, 
     backgrounds, 3D-models, etc. which may be placed or used within
     the Canvas

 - Viewport: a canvas layer for viewing and interacting with
      a 3D object on a 2D computer screen

 - 3D Figure Models: advanced materials for modeling a figure's pose
   - upon placement in the Canvas, a new Viewport layer is added
   - figures have builtin armature 

 - Raster graphics: graphics defined as a lattice of pixels where the finer
    the lattice the greater the resolution

 - Vector graphics: graphics defined as mathematical vectors
    - use-of-term matches how its used in linear algebra
    - has additional feature of being an object itself 
     - in Raster a line is only _implied_ by the interconnection 
       within the lattice, the viewer makes the connection

 - Text: is readable lettering for character's thoughts & words as 
     well as onomatopoeias
     - takes various forms to express tone, emotion, tense, etc.
     - is a form-of-art in itself

 - Balloon tools: artistic containers of Text used to express character's 
    dialog and flow-of-conversation.

 - Frame tools: divides a layer's x-y plane into independent subdivisions
    - this is a kind-of layer mask  

 - Panel: the resulting area created in a layer's subdivision from a Frame tool
    - the active, viewable part of a layer mask

 - Auto Actions: batches commands into a sequential order for replay
    - similar macro recorders or scripts in text based applications

 - Hue: the name of the color
 - Luminosity: brightness of the color
 - Saturation: purity of the color
 - Value: how much white or black are mixed in

 - HLS: Hue, Luminosity, Saturation
  - the color wheel as a triangle
 - HSV: Hue, Saturation, Value
  - the color wheel as a square
  
 - Screentone: a form of shading 
  - an artifact from 20th century comics
  - appears as a lattice of dots whose size 
    and proximity define the value of the shade
  - useful to apply to an imported photo to make it look
    comic-like

Layer Terms
 - Layer: a stack data-structure of visual transparent x-y planes
  - top-of-stack is one closest to eye-of-viewer
   
 - Layer Folder: any logical taxonomic structure within the layer stack
    - may contain zero to many layers and other folders
    
 - Layer Mask: an overlay within a layer that allows for 
     control-over and partition-of visibility of that layer's x-y plane 
     
 - Clip Layer: a kind of layer mask where visibility is defined by the 
    content of another layer, typically the one directly below it
    
 - Reference Layer: a single selected layer among the entire stack of layers
    - defined by the effect it has on the how tools behave on _other_ layers
    
 - Draft Layer: a marker used in the printing process 
   - informs printer to ignore this layer
   
 - Lock Transparent pixel Layer: another kind of layer mask where visibility
    is limited to the layer's existing content
    - unlike a Clip Layer, the effects created while locked will remain 
       even when the lock is removed
       
 - Layer Effects: effects which are applied to all the content of a given layer
 
  - Border effect: adds a border around all the content of a given layer
   - three properties of color, thickness and anti-aliasing on the border
   
  - Tone effect: transforms the content to a screentone
   - Frequency property controls the value of the screentone
   
  - Layer color effect: sets all the content of the layer to some 
     color
    - very useful to keep from making marks on the wrong layer
    
 - Layer Expression color: for controlling the color of all content of 
    the layer.
   - Monochrome: ideal for an ink-layer
   - Gray: ideal for pencil layers
   - Color: should only be used if there actually is some color
----

Selection Terms
 - Selection area: a tool used in the Canvas to select some area 
    from one-or-more layers
  - Selection mode: controls the relation of a selection to 
     other selected areas already present on the canvas
     
 - Selection Command bar: a bar which appears in the canvas upon
   some area being selected.
 
 - perimeter based selection sub-tools
  - work by enclosing some perimeter to from the selected area
  - include: Rectangle, Ellipse, Lasso, Polyline

 - Selection pen: a selection sub-tool used like a highlighter marker
  - directly marking an area instead of drawing a perimeter around it
 
 - Erase selection: a sub-tool to remove some part of the selected area
  - same as selection pen only opposite in effect 
  
 - Shrink selection: a sub-tool which attempts to select only the content
    within the selected area
  - requires some clear sense of boundary 
  - doesn't work across\through content nor on coterminous content
  
 - Scale/Rotate: a command in the Selection Command bar
  - clicking this will cause a the Tool property palette to change to
    allow for the various transformations
  - enables a selection to be moved, flipped, expanded or shrunk
----

----
Subview Palette
 - a palette which can be used to load reference images 
 - allows for various image transformations (e.g. flip, rotate, etc.)
 - allows for color selection from the image it contains
----

----
Snap to options
 - controls how various marks made on the canvas are restricted to 
   match some existing ruler or grid
 - Snap to Ruler: for Linear ruler, Figure ruler and Ruler pen 
 - Snap to Special Ruler: for Symmetry ruler and Perspective ruler
 - Snap to Grid: not related to rulers, for a lattice grid canvas overlay
----

----
Other Art Terms 
 - Perspective: a view defined by the location-of-viewer, viewing direction and lens
 - Stereoscopic vision: the manner in which the mind forms depth and solidity
    by viewing, at the same time, an external object from two slightly different 
    angles
 - Ground Plane: imagined plane extending from the soles of the feet of the viewer
 - Station Point: the orthogonal height off the ground plane (z-axis) 
    of the viewer's eye
 - Line-of-Sight: the vector extending from viewer's eye to the viewed object
   - when line-of-sight is parallel to ground plane then 1 or 2 point perspective 
     results
   - when line-of-sight is angled relative to ground-plane then 3 or 
     5 point (i.e. fish-eye lens) perspective results
 - Horizon Line: the visual line where the ground plane disappears into 
    infinity or curvature
 - Gesture figure-drawing: the initial sketch of a figure which has some simple and 
    proportional representation of the eight body parts 
    (viz. head, spine, rib-cage, pelvis, both arms and both legs)
 - Foreshortening: a perspective effect where some object's length appears to 
    become shorter when moved directly onto the line-of-sight

Create Grey Coloring Brushes
 - to emulate the Koi Coloring Brush Pen(s)
 - copy from 'Brush' tool > 'Thick paint' > 'Oil paint flat brush'
 - name to 'Koi Coloring Brush'
 - change 'Tool icon' to 'Marker'
 - in new marker's Sub Tool Detail
  - set Brush Size to 10
  - in Ink, set Opacity to 50%
   - set the Opacity property to be visible on Tool Property palette
  - in Brush shape > Brush tip 
   - remove the Material copied from the Oil paint flat brush 
   - change Tip shape to Circle
  - remove the visibility of properties copied from Oil paint flat brush
   - leaving only Opacity visible  
 - click 'Save all settings as default' > punch through conf popup
 - Cool Gray RGB 55,57,67
 - Warm Gray RGB 55,49,44

----
Perspective Rulers
 - these are added from the menu bar
  Layer > Ruler\Frame > Create Perspective Ruler...
 - this opens a dialog box to specify the number
   of vanishing points
