Basics
 - computer network is two or more computers that may share information
 - involves addressing - not just a flash drive in the usb
----

----
Internet Protocol Suite
 - the layers between Network Access Layer and Application Layer
 - TCP: Transmission Control Protocol 
 - IP: Internet Protocol
 - UDP: User Datagram Protocol
 - ARP: Address Resolution Protocol
  - resolves a MAC Address to an IP Address & vice versa
  - is part of the Network Access Layer
 - NIC: Network Interface Controller
  - the physical link of a machine to a network
 - MAC Address: Media Access Control Address
  - unique id assigned to a NIC
 - Gateways: where a datagram is sent when 
    the destination address is external
 - NAT: Network Address Translation
  - used to map an internal IP to an generic external one
  - requires the re-writing device (e.g. router, gateway, etc.)
    to keep track of its rewrites to handle responses
 - Socket: combination of IP address and port number
 - DNS: Domain Name System 
  - a distributed database of names to IPs

Internet Protocol Suite Units
                     |  TCP      | UDP     |  
---------------------+-----------+---------+
Application Layer    | stream    | message |
---------------------+-----------+---------+
Transport Layer      | segment   | packet  |
---------------------+-----------+---------+
Internet Layer       | datagram  | datagram|
---------------------+-----------+---------+
Network Access Layer | frame     | frame   |
---------------------+-----------+---------+
 - the datagram contains the source and destination address
 - datagram also contains a protocol number to 
   determine TCP, UDP or otherwise
 - the segment/packet contains the port number

SubNet Mask
 - Subnet mask is series of consecutive 1's followed by 0's
 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 (ie 255.255.255.0)
 - used via bitwise AND operator to reveal what portion of IP is Host Address
 10100000.11010011.10110000.00010000 --IP
 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 --Subnet Mask
 10100000.11010011.10110000.00000000 --Network Portion
 00000000.00000000.00000000.00010000 --Host Portion
----

----
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
 - a short hand way to write both host and subnet mask
 - is in format of address/prefix-length
 - is pronounced 'cider'
 - example:
 172.31.26.32/27
  - means IP 172.31.26.32, subnet mask 255.255.255.224
 10101100.00011111.00011010.00100000
 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000

Domain Name System
 - a DNS server is public and translates IP's to names & vice versa
 - when a DNS server does not have a name-to-IP on file it forwards
   the request to an Authoritative Server 
 - Authoritative Server is responsible for maintaining accurate info
 - DNS communication is UDP on port 53
 - Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND)
  - divided between resolvers and name servers
  - resolvers: software that forms a DNS query
  - name servers: process that responds the resolver's query
----

HUB
 - also known as repeaters
 - singular point to which all ethernet cables terminate
 - like hub of wheel
 - repeats the signal over many cables
 - receive electric signal - repeat out to all those connected
 - at hub layer (layer-2) signal is a 'frame' (a wrapped TCP packet)
 - purely electric devices
 - collision is when two nodes send signals to hub (to be repeated) at same time
 - broadcast domain is region-limit of signal propagation
 - broadcast storms signal repeated out to hub who repeats it back again (loop)
----

----
Switches
 - aware of what device is on what port
 - forwards frames only to intended device
 - collisions only happen at a port level
 - switch makes a dedicated path from port to port for duration of frame trans.
 - switch opens frame and views MAC source/dest address
 - maps source MAC address to port in an internal table
 - forwards frame onto dest. address (already mapped to a port)
 - if dest. address is not mapped then frame is sent to all ports
----

----
Auto-Negotiation
 - allowing two ports to determine their own speed and duplex mode
 - speed is ref'ed as Mbps 
 - Half-duplex mode is sending is exclusive of listening
  - eg is a CB radio in which while speaking one cannot be listening
 - Full-duplex mode is sending and listening at the same time
  - eg a telephone conversation
----

----
Auto-Negotiation setup
 - both ports must be set to allow auto-negotiation
 - if one is not auto-negotiation then it does not happen
 - upon both being auto-negotiation - speed and duplex is decided together
 - speed determined as level that both can handle
  - eg port 1 is 100Mbps and port 2 is 1000Mbps then negotiated speed is 100
 - if full-duplex is enabled on both ends then it is always preferred
 - rule: set both sides to the same 
----

----
VLAN
 - virtual separation of ports on a single switch
 - each separation is a virtual LAN 
 - appears as many switches but is only one switch
 - a router must be used to move frames between VLAN's
  - router is physically hooked to same switch on both sides
 - layer-3 switch has router built-in
----
  
----
Trunking
 - extend a VLAN out to another physical switch
 - portion of VLAN is on one switch, other portion on another
 - truck allows two sides of same VLAN to communicate
 - communication across trunk requires special 'tagging' protocol
  - IEEE 802.1Q 
  - Inter-Switch Link (ISL): Cisco proprietary protocol
----

----
Spanning Tree
 - used to eliminate the Broadcast Storms
 - a bridge may be a switch or hub - in practice is always a switch
 - tree determined by passing of Bridge Protocol Data Units
 - each bride is assigned a bridge ID
 - ID is combo of MAC Address and assigned bridge priority
 - MAC address is a unique id assigned by the manufacturer
 - tree constructed of bridges forming into a 'tree' based on bridge priority
 - not a routing protocol, used to eliminate loops in data passing
----

----
Routers
 - router that moves data out of its origin network
 - there are many protocols
 - packets received are forwarded on if a route is listed in device's table
 - if no route then forwarded on to gateway router
 - if no gateway then packet is dropped
 - routers communicate to each other through specific protocols
  - used to determine state facts of bandwidth
  - upon completion of protocols - each protocol is ranked lowest wins
  - protocol ranking is known as Administrative Distance
   - OSPF is above RIP
   - IGRP is above OSPF 
   - etc
----

----
Network Terms
 - Classful makes no notification of an networks subnet mask
 - Classful routing protocol is no longer used
 - Classless routing protocol is one that notifies other routers of subnet mask
 - Poision Reverse: router alerting others that a network is no longer available
 - Convergence: state in which all routers have all updates about network
 - Internal Gateway Protocols 
  - protocols that control an autonomous system
  - autonomous system as a single entry point
  - RIP, EIGRP and OSPF are all Internal Gateway Protocols
 - External Gateway Protocols
  - only concerned with the least # of hops across IGP's
  - EGP is a connection of many IGP's
 - Redistribution is act of translating route table from one protocol to another
  - redistribution is not done automatically
 - Static Route: route entered manually, not learned via protocol
 - Broadcast: packet sent to all connected nodes
 - Multicast: packet sent to many connected nodes, but done selectively
 - Unicast: packet sent along singular path
----

----
Tunnels
 - have a local device communicate with a remote device as if both were local
 - GRE: allow remote networks to appear to be locally connected
  - Generic Routing Encapsulation
  - hides IP packets inside IP packets
  - offers no encryption
  - allows for Mutlicast and Broadcast
 - VPN: 
  - encrypts all inner packets
  - GRE are built w/i VPN
  - not multicast or broadcast
  - two flavors
   - point-to-point: router to router
   - remote-access: single user to router, firewall or special VPN device 
----

----
Multilayer Switch
 - complex switch that contains many VLANs and connects them with a router
 - called multilayer since it interacts above normal switch layer 2 of OSI
 - can do most everything
----

----
Teleco terms
 - Analog Signal: signal that is continuous
  - same amplitude and time
 - Digital Signal: single with discrete values over time
  - incur a lose of precision when converting analog to digital
  - difference is same as statistic's discrete vs. continuous
 - Bandwidth:
  - originally an analog only term
  - refers to a length in hertz between two discrete frequencies
  - FM Radio is 87.9 to 107.9 having a bandwidth of 20MHz
  - digital bandwidth refers to throughput
  - measure of number of possible state changes in a second's time
  - measure is known as bits-per-second
 - DEMARC
  - term that refers to the point were telco providers responsibilities end
  - point where your (admin) responsibilities begin
 - Latency: delay in both time for signal to travel and time signal processing
  - Propagation delay: is travel part
   - two links have same speed, one is geographically further
  - Processing delay: is processing part
   - two links at same geo-distance but link1 is slower because use of old equip
 - Multiplexing:
  - adding signals and sharing on one signal
  - T1 takes 24 64-Kbps channels into one
 - PBX: Private Branch Exchange
 - POTS: Plain Old Telephone Service
----

----
T1
 - all T1s are digital
  - there is such thing as analog signaling for voice  
  - also digital signaling for data
  - analog channel must be converted to digit before transmission
 - Channelized T1: 
  - voice circuit 
  - 24 voice channels
  - each channel has its own signaling info
  - like actual tones upon btn press - they are in the voice channel
 - Primary Rate Interface (PRI)
  - 23 voice channels
  - 1 signal channel
  - known as out-of-band signaling
  - signal channel sets up the call
  - one of 23 voice is used to carry the voice
---- 

----
T1 Encoding
 - Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI)
  - for voice 
  - 1-value bits are signaled as +5V or -5V alternating after each other
  - 0-value bits are signaled as space 0V
Digital 0  0  1  0  0  1  0  1  1  1  0  0  1
Voltage 0  0 +5  0  0 -5  0 +5 -5 +5  0  0 -5
  - many zeros will cause recipient to loss track
  - w/ many 0 in a row cannot tell where signal ends/begins
  - to hold signal every 8th bit is always set to 1
   - not noticeable in voice
   - critical fail for data
   
 - Binary Eight Zero Substitution
  - for voice or data
  - same as AMI
  - upon eight 0 bits, flat line is converted from sender to specific pattern
Digital 0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  0
Voltage 0 +5  0 -5 -5  0  0 +5 +5  0  0 -5 +5  0
             ^----              ----^         
            (this area is the pattern)
  - allows for continued sync
----

----
Framing
 - single sample is converted to one byte
 - 8000 samples per minute is 8kHz
 - In-Band Signaling
  - every eighth bit is used for signaling
 - Out-of-Band Signaling
  - entire channel for signaling
  - all eight bits for data
 -D4 Superframe is organized in a repeating pattern
  - one sample is 8 bits, bit eight being the signal
  - each channel of T1 is sampled one-at-a-time
   - after 24 samples all 24 channels have been passed through
  - 24 samples make 192bits, another signal bit is added to make a Frame
  - Superframe is 12 Frames (2316 bits)
 - Extended Superframe (ESF)
  - D4 not suitable for data
  - is 24 frames
  - frames are used for patterning, data, error checking
----

----
DS3
 - multiplex of T1s
 - Channelized DS3 is aggregate of 28 DS1s (T1s)
 - Clear-Channel DS3 has no channels and is all data
----

----
Firewalls
 - designed to prohibit all in and out traffic
  - packet-filtering firewall: allows a packet to 
    pass or drops a packet based on its origin address,
	dest. address and port number
  - Circuit-level gateway: is a man-in-the-middle where 
    the bytes from the origin are copied and sent to the 
	dest.
  - application-level gateway: only allows traffic for
    certain apps - examples are email, http\s, ftp and dns
 - DMZ is a "3rd" part of the network
  - is neither in or out of the network
  - is connected to the outside through the firewall 
  - is where you place Web, Email and DNS Servers
  - idea is that it may be accessed from outside with rules
  - prohibit DMZ devices from connecting to inside network devices
  - inside may connect to DMZ
  - outside may or may not connect to DMZ, depending on setting
  - typical DMZ allowance
   - TCP port 110 (Email POP)
   - TCP port 143 (Email IMAP)
   - TCP port 25 (Email SMTP)
   - TCP port 80 (Web HTTP)
   - TCP port 443 (Web HTTPS)
   - UDP port 53 (DNS)
   - TCP port 53 (DNS) (sometimes)
----

----
Load Balancing
 - single machine sit between Firewall and server farm
 
 - DNS Load Balancing
  - round-robin
  - single name resolves to many servers
  - not able to react to in-balance on a single server
 - Bridged Load Balancing
  - use virtual IP to resolve to many servers (IPs)
  - performed at lower network layer
 - Routed Load Balancing
  - similar to bridged in that resolved to single virtual IP
  - virtual IP is on a network different from servers themselves
  - is limitless in expandability

 Virtual Server: IP address used to access services running on real servers
 Server Farm: logical grouping of servers 
 Real Server: physical server that is bound to a virtual server
