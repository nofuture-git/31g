Survival Signals
 - signs or behaviors that should indicate danger is eminent
 - typically with regards to strangers
 
 (1) Forced Teaming: an effective way to est. a premature trust 
     typically thought the use of the pronoun "we".  Is not 
     coincidence but is intentional and direct
 (2) Charm and Niceness: charm should be considered a verb not 
     a trait.  Reflect as, "this person is attempting to charm me"
     and not as, "this person is so charming". Niceness does not
     equal goodness.
 (3) Too Many Details: signals need for additional support and is 
     given by a perp to mentally support what they know is bullshit.
     Also helps to confuse the obvious context of an interaction.
 (4) Typecasting: an label intended as an slight insult that is 
     easily refuted.  It should be met with stone-cold silence.
 (5) Loan Sharking: offering help with intent to place someone in
     a preceived debt making it more difficult for them to decline 
     further incursion.
 (6) Unsolicited Promise: most reliable in its obviousness, an 
     attempt to build trust where none was ever asked.  One should
     always be suspicious of this one.
 (7) Ignoring "No":  declining to hear, "no" is a signal that someone
     is either seeking control or refusing to relinquish it.
