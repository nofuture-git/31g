Survival Signals
 - signs or behaviors that should indicate danger is eminent
 - typically with regards to strangers
 
 (1) Forced Teaming: an effective way to est. a premature trust 
     typically thought the use of the pronoun "we".  Is not 
     coincidence but is intentional and direct
 (2) Charm and Niceness: charm should be considered a verb not 
     a trait.  Reflect as, "this person is attempting to charm me"
     and not as, "this person is so charming". Niceness does not
     equal goodness.
 (3) Too Many Details: signals need for additional support and is 
     given by a perp to mentally support what they know is bullshit.
     Also helps to confuse the obvious context of an interaction.
 (4) Typecasting: an label intended as an slight insult that is 
     easily refuted.  It should be met with stone-cold silence.
 (5) Loan Sharking: offering help with intent to place someone in
     a preceived debt making it more difficult for them to decline 
     further incursion.
 (6) Unsolicited Promise: most reliable in its obviousness, an 
     attempt to build trust where none was ever asked.  One should
     always be suspicious of this one.
 (7) Ignoring "No":  declining to hear, "no" is a signal that someone
     is either seeking control or refusing to relinquish it.

We are looking for the use of a sign, but we look for it as though it 
were an object co-existing with the sign.

The thing to do in such cases is always to look how the words 
in question are actually used in our language.  We are in all such cases
thinking of a use different from that which our ordinary language makes 
of the words.  When something seems queer about the grammar of our words, 
it is because we are alternately tempted to use a word in several different ways.
And it is particularly difficult to discover that an assertion which the 
metaphysician makes expresses discontentment with our grammar when the words 
of this assertion can also be used to state a fact of experience. (pg 57-58)

One can defend common sense against the attacks of philosophers only by 
solving their puzzles, i.e., by curing them of the temptation to attack common 
sense; not by restating the views of common sense.

The meaning of a phrase for us is characterized by the use we make of it. The
meaning is not a mental accompaniment to the expresson. (61)

I want to play chess, and a man gives the white king a paper crown, leaving the 
use of the piece unaltered, but telling me that the crown has a meaning to him
in the game, which he can't express by rules.  I say: "as long as it doesn't 
alter the use of the piece, it hasn't what I call a meaning".(61)

Imagine a language in which, instead of "I found nobody in the room", one said
"I found Mr. Nobody in the room".  Imagine the philosophical problems which 
would arise out of such a convention.  Some philosophers brought up in this 
language would probably feel they didn't like the similarity of the expressions
"Mr. Nobody" and "Mr. Smith". (69)

The use of a word in practice is its meaning. (69)

"I never know what the other really means by 'brown' or what he really sees 
when he (truthfully) says the the sees a brown object".  We could propose to 
one who says this to use two different words instead of one word "brown"; 
one word for his particular impression, the other word with that meaning which
other people besides himself can understand as well. (72-73)
