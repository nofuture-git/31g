Arch basics
 - is additive since its being built atop whole OS images
 - logical division is hosts, containers and images
  - hosts run containers
  - containers are created from images
  - image is single, complete and self-containted
 - there are base images which are like full OS .iso
  - what is built upon it is a sequence of changes 
    (e.g. installs, commands, etc.)
 - images are then avail on various web hosts
 - Docker Hub is large repo for Linux distros and Microsoft Windows
 - Docker Cloud is a pub\priv repo with auth control
 - Docker Store is a commercial repo to purchase images    
----

----
Various Windows Paths
C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Docker
C:\ProgramData\Docker
 - this is the location of the built images
C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop
C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Docker

 - settings file at
 C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Docker\settings.json

 - corp proxy server syntax as:
 username:password@proxy.host.com:8080
 
 - to print the current settings
 docker info

CLI basics
 - is a Windows Service in Windows (Daemon otherwise)
 - the Docker CLI issues its commands to this local win service
 - obviously these can be separated across diff machines
 - typically two task are to package an image and to run an image
 - using Windows or Linux containers is a global setting
  - can be set from the context menu of the tray icon
 
 C:\> docker image build --file myCustomDockerFile --tag myuser/my-app .
  - notice the "." at the end - this is the output directory
  - tag convention is {user}/{app}
  - the "--file" switch allows for override implied "Dockerfile" filename 
    with some custom docker file name
 
 C:\> docker container run --interactive --tty --name myalias myuser/my-app powershell
  - the "powershell" at the end is actually run in the container
  - the "--name" is to assign some name other than the very long hex value
  
 C:\> docker container run --interactive --tty --volume C:\MyHostMachine:C:\MyDockerImg myuser/my-app powershell 
  - "--volume" is to share some directory with the container while its running
   - takes the form of {source}:{target}
----

----
Swarm basics
 - a composition of two or more running docker images
 - there exist some form of interprocess comm between individual containers
  - the over-the-wire comm is encrypted using digital certs
----

----
Docker files
 - are the composition of images as a declarative and procedural 
   sequence of statements
 - is a token-word kind of lang
  (e.g. FROM, COPY, RUN, CMD, WORKDIR)
 - require some base images\OS either locally or from Docker Hub
 - statement delimiter is LF 
 - files are in UTF-8
 
 FROM microsoft/dotnet
 - example of most basic possible dockerfile - is just the base image itself
 - escape-sequence is the C-style backslash so Windows file paths
   need the double-slash "\\"
 - octothrop (\x23) is to define a directive 
 
 # escape=`
  - "escape=`" would redefine esc-char to match powershell, allow for
    less double-slash in windows paths

 ARG MY_CUST_ARG=FOO
 - allow for variable def's in docker file with default values
 - use the variable as
  C:\> docker image build --build-arg MY_CUST_ARG=BAR --tag myuser/my-image

 EXPOSE 80
 - has port 80 exposed to receive
 - to link it to a running image
  
  C:\> docker container run --detach --publish 80 --name myalias myuser/my-image
  
  C:\> docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}' myalias

 SHELL ["powershell"] 
 - has the default shell changed from CMD.exe to PowerShell.exe
 
 VOLUME C:\\app\\logs
 - defines a persisted directory within an image
 - what is written\changed within it will remain
  - differs from typicaly image-as-an-ISO where everything is always
    read-only
  - useful for containers to keeps logs
  
  C:\> docker container run --interactive --tty --name myalias myuser/my-app
   - first have to assign some alias to a container
  
  C:\> docker container run --interactive --tty --volumes-from myalias myuser/my-other-app
   - can also be written as "myalias:ro" for "read-only" 
   - will be present on the host machine, 
   
  C:\> docker container inspect --format '{{ json .Mounts }}' myalias | ConvertFrom-Json
