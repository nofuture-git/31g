Graph Theory (Formal)
 - beyond common use, is a formal abstract concept
 - the name for discipline concerned with study of graphs
  - constructing
  - exploring
  - visualizing
  - understandings
 - is composed of points (also called vertices or nodes)
 - has lines (also called edges or links) which connect points
 - represent structured data
 - represent the relationships of data
 
 Terms
 - nodes (vertices): is the discrete data of the graph 
 
 - edges (links): represent the relation among the nodes'
 
 - join: formal name for what the edge is doing; namely, joining
    two nodes.
 
 - triple: the next most elementary unit, a subgraph of two nodes 
           connected by one directed edge 
 
 - adjacent (abutting): the state between to nodes when there is one edge
    between them.
    
 - connected: when a indirect route connects one node to another
 
 - distance: the number of edge traversals required to reach one
    node from another
    
 - geodesic: fancy name for shortest-distance
 
 - loop: the state of an edge connecting a node back to itself
 
 - multiple edge: when there is another edge which joins the same
    pair of nodes
    
 - simple graph: a graph with no loops or multiple edges
 
 - degree: the number of edges being joined to a single node
 
 - degree of separation: the average number of edges between any two nodes
 
 - density: the number of edges over the number of possible edges
 
 - connectedness: fraction of all groups of two nodes where there is an 
    edge between them
    
 - betweenness: the number of times some node was passed-through 
    for every possible node-pair.
    
 - subgraph: a subset of nodes and edges of another graph
 
 - induced subgraph: a subgraph where only the nodes or only 
    the edges are known.
 
 - bijection: ("by Jove its a perfect match") one and 
      only one girl for every boy and nobody is alone.
    Boys Girls
     1 -> A
     2 -> B
     3 -> C
     4 -> D
     
 - surjective: ("sure we can share") one girl 
      for every boy but some boys have to 
      share the same girl, but at least 
      no one is alone
   Boys Girls  
    1 -> A
    2 -> A
    3 -> B
    4 -> C
    
 - injective: ("intense feelings of loneness") one girl 
      for every boy and no boy ever shares the same 
      girl, but some girls are all alone
   Boys  Girls
    1 -> A
    2 -> B
    3 -> C
         D
         
 - non-surjective & non-injective: ("no! no!") state of 
      some girls being all alone and some girls sharing boys
   Boys Girls
    1 -> A
    2 -> A
    3 -> B
         D

 - isomorphic graph: when two graphs are drawn the same
 
 - automorphic graph: when two graphs are drawn the same
    and their underlying structured data is the same.
    
 - label: by being labeled a node or edge becomes definititive 
    like being an instance.
    
 - directed graph (digraph): when the edges are an ordered pair
 
 - directed acyclic: a directed graph with no cycles
 
 - edge head: the v1 in the ordered pair (v1,v2)
 
 - edge tail: the v2 in the ordered pair (v1,v2)
 
 - indegree: number of head-edges for a given node
 
 - outdegree: number of tail-edges for a given node
 
 - clique (egocentric): set of connected nodes where beginning at 
    one node you may navigate to any other member of the
	clique via one edge
    
 - complete graph: every node is connected to every other 
    node via an edge and is equal to n*(n-1)/2
    
 - path: another name for a route, also called a walk
 
 - simple path: if the route never visits the same node twice
 
 - open path: when the first and last nodes are different
 
 - closed path: when the first and last nodes are the same
    also known as a cycle
    
 - simple cycle: same as simple closed path except the origin 
    node is the only one visited twice (being the terminus)
    
 - tree graph: has an originating root node
 
 - parent\child: same as used in XML
 
 - leaf: a child node with not children of its own
 
 - descendant: in tree graph, used the same as in a family tree
 
 - ancestor: again, tree graph, like a family tree
 
 - weighted graph: where the edge is the node pair and a weight
 
 - network: a weighted directed graph
 
 - lattice: an graph which, when visualized, appears like 
            the architectural feature of the same name 
 
 - hub: a node having a high outdegree
 
 - authority: a node having a high indegree
 
 - morphism: specific to directed graphs being another general name
    for an edge but differs by having some edges labeled and then 
    expressing others edges as label-of-labels or combinations of 
    other edge labels 
    (in DOT syntax where the '[label="blah"]' is how to label an edge)
    X -> Y [label="f"]
    Y -> Z [label="g"]
    X -> Z [label="g & f"] //named in terms of the other two
    
  - "inscrutable hairballs": when complex graphs in any visualization 
    just looks like a hair ball

Representing a Graph
 - adjacency list: represent each node as a key and the value 
    as an array of adjacent nodes.
 [1], [2,3,3]	would mean node 1 has one edge connecting it 
                 to node 2 and two edges connecting it to node 
 [2], [1,4]     node 2 has one edge connecting it to node 1 and 
                 one edge connecting it to node 4
 
 - adjacency matrix: an exhaustive list of propositions concerning 
    is node v_i connected to node v_j 
   - requires alot more memory to represent; namely n^2

	.-         -.
    | 0 1 1 0 0 |  would mean the same for the first two rows as 
	| 1 0 0 1 0 |   above
	| 1 0 0 1 0 |
	| 0 1 1 0 1 |
	| 0 0 0 1 1 |
	`-         -'
  - use the 'sna' R package for application of many graph terms
    to actual instance of adjacency matrix
  myAdjGraph <- rgraph(n,m=1,tprob=0.5,mode="(digraph|graph)" [...]) #sna adjancency graph
   - n is number of nodes, matrix is always square
   - tprop is the probability of a link
   - mode is obvious, other default value args see 'help(package="sna")'
  myIGraph <- graph.adjacency(myAdjGraph, mode="(undirected|directed") #type cast to igraph
  - applied terms 
   plot(graph)               #view it as a pic
   degree(myIGraph)          #degree
   gden(graph,mode="graph")  #density 
   connectedness(graph_adj)  #connectedness
   is.connected(graph)       #test if connectedness equal to 1
   is.isolate(graph,[1-9]+)  #test if node, by index, has no edges
   betweenness(graph)        #betweenness
   geodist(graph_adj)        #shorted-dist, calc'ed on whole
   ego.extract(graph_adj)    #get all the cliques
 
 - import adjacency matrix example
  library(sna)
  library(igraph)
  myData <- read.table("C:/Temp/MyData.tsv",header=FALSE)
  myMatrix <- as.matrix(myData)
  myAdj <- graph.adjacency(myMatrix, mode="directed")
