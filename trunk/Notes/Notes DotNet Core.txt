Terminalogy (mostly NuGet in origin)
 - Moniker: the keyword name used to specify 
    a framework, runtime or platform (e.g. net471)
 - Target Framework: flavor of .NET 
  - e.g. net471, netcoreapp1.0
 - .NET Standard: another kind of target framework
    which works for all
  - a kind of, "I don't need to specify the 
    target framework because it works on all of them..."
 - Runtime: a couple of operating system and CPU arch
  - e.g osx.10.11-x64, linuxmint.17.1.x86
 - Platform: used without any sense to 
   mean runtime, framework, both or all
