 Intentional         Negligence           Strict Liability
 - Battery           - unreasonable       - limited
 - Assault           & unintentionable    - accidental 
 - Tresprass                              & careful
 - False imprisonment
 - Conversion
 - "outrage" 
 - Defamation 
  - dignitary torts
  - slander 
  - libel
  
 - "outrage": intentional infliction of emotional distress
 - wrongful death/survival action: procedural distinction where 
    plantiff is dead
 - "Tort" means injury, 
  - from Latin tortus: wrung, twisted
 - is "common law" because it arises out of judge-made law 
 - is "civil" because its not about criminal violations
  - does not remedy through punishment
  - attempts to compensate  
   - Punitive Damages: monetary sums awarded by judge or jury for the purpose
     of punishing tort defendants
 - is "wrongs" because its tied up to moral concept
  - as moral concept, gets tricky, some domains attempt to do away with this
    with 'no-fault liability doctrins'
  - is intangled in moral philosophy, social mores and folkways
  - is likewise coupled to social practices
  - is shaped by social institutions like insurance companies
 - is "not arising out of contract" because recognizes obligations which are 
   independent of any agreement
  - settlement: the resolution of tort law cases is a kind of contract itself
    - est. 95% resolved this way
 - concern kinds of questions of fact and law
   - fact of causation
   - fact of intent
   - what the law is or what is ought to be
 - is billion dollar business 
  - 1.82% of GDP in 2010
  - engaging tort law in public court system is almost always 
    bad for biz for both sides 
  - actual values, facts, outcomes, etc. have no public record whatsoever
  - American tort system, therfore, is only known to insurers
   - is party-driven, 
   - highly opaque
   - radically decentralized
   - and vast
 - on the whole, is tautological
  - e.g. intent: acting with substantial certainty
         substantial certainty: is not mere knowledge and awareness of 
          inherent risks
  - in America, its just business (money)
 - Tortfeasor: person or entity that committed the tort
 - Estate: whatever the tortfeasor was a member of which you can get money from
 - Affirmative Defense: a kind-of immediate-escape from liability
    - Intentional tort
     - self defense
     - consent
   - Negligence
    - assumption of risk
    - contributory negligence
----

Intentional Tort: 
 1. Act (Volition), 
 2. Intent, 
 3. Contact (this is where differentiation occurs), 
 4. Causation (results)

 - Volitional action: really, only understood by its opposite
 - Reflexive action: obviously involuntary
 - 'lift my arm to hit you' is volitional
 - 'was falling and lifted arm' is reflexive
 
 - Intent: basically motive without the "why"
  - knew the punch would land on-yo-face
   - it does not matter 'why' I wanted this, 
     I knew it would land on-yo-face (yee-ahh)
  - wanna punch dat-bi'ch and da-bouncer 
    in-da-way - punch anyway (its still battery)
  - its a matter of preception
   - "looked right at me with a mean look and then..."
----

----
Battery
 - intent to cause harmful contact
 - occurrence of harmful contact 
 - actually caused harm
 - in terms of "these" damages
  - Single Intent: expected that something bad may result
  - Dual Intent: wanna throw-a-punch, but also wanted something
     bad to result
 - Restatement 2d. section 18  
  - an actor is subject to liability to another for battery if he acts 
    intending to cause a harmful of offensive contact with the person 
    of the other or a third person, or an imminent apprehension of such 
    a contact, and an offensive contact with the person of the other 
    directly or indirectly results.
----

----
Assault
 - same a battery except that, "it felt like they would!"
 - requires both fear plantiff is about to attack and plantiff is indeed 
   capable of attacking
 - battery which is incomplete, 
  - pulling the trigger on a gun, which only I know is not-loaded, while
    pointing it directly at another
 - emotional & dignitary assult
  - limited, everyday friction and unpleasant encounters is not assault
----

----
False Imprisonment
 - confinement of a person to a limited area
----

----
Trespass
 - invasion of someone else's property interest
 - trespass-to-land: invasion into real property
 - trespass-to-chattel: invasion into personal property
----

----
Conversion
 - chattel trespass where tortfeasor caused "serious" damage
----

----
Consent
 - an affirmative defense against liability of intentional tort
          Consent
             |
      +------+------+
      |             |
   Implied       Express
      |
 +----+----------+
 |               |
in-fact        in-law
 - Express: actually saying it out-loud or in writing
 - Implied In-Fact: expected circumstance, didn't object or leave
 - Scope-of-Consent: implied consent is limited to some circumstance
 - Implied In-Law: rare, used by first responders on unresponsive persons
 - Invalidated by 
  - Duress: threat of force
  - Fraud: consent based on lies
  - Mistake: based on ambiguous assumptions
  - Incapacity: drunk, insain, etc.
  - Illegality: cannot consent to what is simply illegal
----

----
Degree of Force
 - the other affirmative defense against liability of intentional tort
 - an equal amount of force against an invasion of whatever.
  - Proportionate: defense was equal to threat
  - Necessary: no other way to repel invasion
 - of three forms:
  - self-defense
  - defense of others
  - defense of property
----

----
Necessity
 - another kind of defense (aka privilage) against intentional tort
  - Public Necessity: is a complete privilege where no liability can be held
    - e.g. stopping zombies by blowing up your lab
  - Private Necessity: is incomplete, reasonable purpose for trespass but still
     gotta pay for the damage
----

----
Negligence:
 1. Duty (owed to be mindful to others) 
 2. Breach (didn't do such duty), 
 3. Causation (breach was the direct cause), 
 4. Damages (suffered actual harm, not just emotional harm)
 - differs in that its more what you didn't do
 - Duty and Breach est. fault, taking the place of Intent 
   in intentional tort
----

----
Assumption of Risk
 - a affirmative defense against negligence tort
----

----
Contributory\Comparative Negligence
 - the other affirmative defense against negligence tort
----

----
Reasonableness & Foreseeability
 - recurrent concepts in affirmative defense of liability
 - are coupled to each other in definition since what is not forseeable
   is therefore unreasonable
 - are opaque concepts
