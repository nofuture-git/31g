Security Identifiers
security principles: encompassing name for accounts (user, groups)

Security Identifiers(SID): unique ID for a security principle
 > SIDs are never reused - even upon deletion
 > Always begin with "S"
 
Local Security Authority(LSA): generates SID for local security
 > SID stored in local db

Domain Security Authority(DSA): generates SID for domain security
 > SID stored in Active Directory

Well Known SIDs:  those within all windows computers
S-1-1-0             Everyone
S-1-5-18            LocalSystem
S-1-5-19            LocalService
S-1-5-20            NetworkService
S-1-5-domain-500    Administrator
S-1-5-domain-501    Guest
S-1-5-32-544        Administrators 
S-1-5-32-545        Users 
S-1-5-32-546        Guests 
S-1-5-32-547        Power Users
S-1-5-32-555        Remote Desktop Users  
----

----
Globally Unique Identifiers(GUIDs): unique ID for objects (eg computer, device)
 > Hexadecimal numbers in groups of 8, 4, 4, 12 characters
 > Enclosed in curly braces
----
 
----
Root Keys: 5 subdivisions
 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT     HKCR
HKEY_CURRENT_USER     HKCU
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE    HKLM
KKEY_USERS            HKU
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG   HKCC
----

----
Linked Keys: a key may be a reference to another key, the later key being the actual key.  The example is HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles

Where ...\0000 is the actual key
and   ...\Current is a reference to 0000
and   HKCC is a reference to ...\Current 
----

----
Key's Values: that which is contained within a key (think files)
Name: 
 > 256 unicode character limit
 > must not begin with \ * ?
 > no duplicate names within key
 > duplicate names allowed across keys
 > duplicate names does not mean duplicate objects
 > begin with . is reserved for windows
Type:
 > similar to primitive types 
Data:
 > value limit to 32767 bytes
 > practical limit 2000 bytes
 > are value-type variables
 > only one type is reference-type
----

----
Key Value Types: actual data representatives of the key values primitive types
REG_BINARY: binary data represented in hex notation - one of three most used 
REG_DWORD: 32 bit - two of three most used
 > used as boolean values
 > store time-value in milliseconds
 > intel based is little-endian
REG_SZ: fixed-length text - three of three most used
 > string ends with 'null' character (0x00)
 > environment variables not expandable
REG_EXPAND_SZ: variable length text
 > may include environment variables
 > calling program expands environment variable
 > example:  %USERPROFILE%\Favorites becomes C:\Document\userName\Favorites
REG_LINK: a link value type
 > may not be created by regedit
REG_MULTI_SZ: binary data that is an array of strings
 > null character (0x00) separates array elements
 > double null character ends array
[There are others not listed]

Note: application may store there own value types in REG_BINARY, also app's may use REG_BINARY when REG_DWORD or REG_SZ is more applicable.

Note: key value types are enumerated
0   REG_NONE
1   REG_SZ
2   REG_EXPAND_SZ
3   REG_BINARY
4   REG_DWORD
4   REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN
5   REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN
6   REG_LINK
7   REG_MULTI_SZ
8   REG_RESOURCE_LIST
----

----
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS: are the only root keys stored on disk by the Windows OS.  
HKCU linked HKU
HKCR and HKCC linked to HKLM
----

----
HKEY-USER:  minimum three sub-keys
 > .DEFAULT:  generic settings used before user specifies otherwise
 > Console User SID:  Per User settings and linked to HKCU
 > SID_Classes:  per user class and file association
    - merge HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes and HKU\Classes into HKCU

S-1-5-18: SID for LocalSystem account
S-1-5-19: SID for LocalService account
S-1-5-20: SID for NetworkService account
----    

----
HKEY_CURRENT_USER: 
 > per user settings
 > root is link to HKU\<SID>
 
 Subkeys
  > AppEvents: maps sounds to events
  > Console: data for console subsystem
  > Control Panel: same as interface with a few additions
  > Environment: user-set enviro variables
  > Identities: Outlook Express related
  > Keyboard Layout: obvious
  > Network: mapped drives
  > Printers: 
  > Software: per-user app settings, schema of HKCU\Vendor\Program\Version
  > Volatile Environment: 
----

----
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  > Machine settings
  > HKCU\Software linked to HKLM\SOFTWARE
  
Subkeys
 > HARDWARE: per restart creation, info on device, drivers and device reasources
 > SAM: Security Accounts Manager, security database, linked HKLM\SECURITY\SAM
 > SECURITY: security settings, contains SAM, not viewable
 > SOFTWARE: machine app settings, Windows settings
 > SYSTEM: control settings, one is current linked via HKLM\SYSTEM\Select
 ---- 
 
 ----
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
  > Is a merge of HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes and HKCU\Software\Classes
  > Contains file-type associations
  > Contains COM registrations
----

----
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
 > linked to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\Current
----

----
Hive Files: registry files on physical disk
 > Hive files are binary in type
 > HKLM & HKU are only keys on disk
 > HKLM:  C:\WINDOWS\System32\Config (hive file location)
    - HKLM\HARDWARE:  this is built each time Windows loads
    - HKLM\SAM:  C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\SAM
    - HKLM\SECURITY:  C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\SECURITY
    - HKLM\SOFTWARE:  C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\Software
    - HKLM\SYSTEM:  C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\System
 > HKU: 
    - HKU\.DEFAULT:  C:\WINDOWS\System32\Config\default
    - HKU\<sid>:  C:\Documents and Settings\bstarrett\NTUSER.DAT
    - HKU\<sid>_Classes:  C:\Documents and Settings\bstarrett\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat

File > Export

.REG
 > Unicode characters (2 bytes)
 > text file type
 > file can be edited in text editor
 > merged into registry

Win9x/NT .REG
 > ANSI characters (1 byte) 
 > text file type

 > Same as physical hive on disk
 > Import, replace registry keys
 > Load, new hive - view in regedit
 
.TXT 
 > More readable then .reg
