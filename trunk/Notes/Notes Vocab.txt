  objects are represented from the parts of a program that deal

generic procedures: procedures that can operate on data that
  may be represented in more than one way.
aliasing: a single computational object being accessed by more than
  one name.

  which computational elements can be manipulated.
 - named as variables
 - passed as args
 - returned as results
 - included in data structures
sets: mutable unordered collection of unique and immutable objects.
tuples: immutable sequences of object references accessed by offset
dictionaries: mutable mappings of object references accessed by key
lists: mutable sequences of object references accessed by offset
parser: recognize grammatical structures in a token stream
 - parsers differ from compilers & interpreters because they only 
   consider the 'form' and not the 'meaning' of the symbols
lexers: recognize grammatical structures in a character stream
identity: idea that a computational object is something
  different from the pieces & properties of which it is composed.

 but those changes are governed by laws that do not change
static process: concerns time where state does not change
substitution model -vs- environment model:
 the substitution model is like classical mathematical notation
 the environment model is involved with time and thereby has 
 state being time-dependent but identity being time independent
pure functions: functions which do not change any state and treat 
 their args as read-only.
propositional logic: concerns the truth-value of a sentence (aka clause).
free variable: a kind of substitution of a sentence's subject (replace 
 the subject with say 'X').
open formula: what a sentence (aka clause) becomes when its
 subject is replaced by an free variable.
logic quantifier: the kinds of predicates which are applicable to
 an open formula (e.g. All, Any)
predicate logic: concerns the truth-value of logic quantifier on 
 an open formula.
non-monotonic logic: idea of default-value, cars have four wheels - no 
 reason to doubt without some obvious reason.
stream: a way of modeling state as sequence in time (similar to how 
 a linear equation is one thing but is infinite when graphed)
tableau: a stream of streams
event loop -vs- game loop: event loops only continue upon user input
 while game loops continue regardless of user input
partial application: partial application is when the number of args 
 of a function expression are reduced.  For example in going from 
 "let pow x x = x^x" to "let sqr x = pow x 2"
monand: a computational structure which statisfies three rules:
  left identity: bind(unit(e),k) = k(e)
  right identity: bind(m,unit) = m
  associative: bind(m,x => bind(k(x),y => h(y))) 
                   = bind(bind(m,x => k(x)),y => h(y))
point -vs- vector [Linear Algebra]: 
  - are two different geometric entities
  - a point is a position on a 2d coordinate plane
  - a vector is a difference of two points which describes 
    a direction and distance
  - a vector is coordinate-independent a point is not
compiler -vs- transpiler: 
 - a compiler results in a direct executable artifact 
   while a transpiler results in further code which 
   must be itself either compiled or interpretated
pascel case -vs- camel case -vs- kabab case -vs- snake-case
 Pascel case: MyVariable
 Camel case:  MyVariable | myVariable
 Kabab case:  my-variable
 Snake case:  my_variable
lint: the name give to a program which scans a code 
 base in order to report suspicious and non-portable
 constructs
duck typing -vs- normal typing:
 both regard idea of suitability of a runtime obj passed
 to a f(x).  duck-typing suitability is determined by presence
 of expected methods and properties. normal-typing suitability 
 is determined by the object's type.
