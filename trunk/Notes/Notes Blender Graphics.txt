Overview
 - an open-source 3D computer graphics software platform
 - uses range from film animation, visual effects, 3D printing
   and video games
 - the abbrev. "UV" is simply to represent its not "XYZ"
 - is designed to be interfaced with one-hand-on-keyboard\one-hand-on-mouse
  - abbrev. for mouse button is LMB (left mouse button) 
    a RMB (right) and (MMB) for middle (MMB is sub'ed with ALT+LMB)
  - RMB is used for selecting items within scene
  - LMB is used for clicking interface options (i.e. context-menu)
  
 - 3D Cursor: a kind of central point for control and placement of objects
 
 - GUI typically windows
  - 3D View: main window, like the code editor in an IDE
  - Outliner: the project view
   - use the numpad (+) and (-) keys to fold\unfold nodes
  - Properties: the properties of whole project
  - Info: the py commands of the various actions 
  
 - Split screen is controlled from top-right corner of 
   3D View (appearing as 3 diagonal lines)  
  - LMB click and drag this to have the same 3D view in two 
    side-by-side windows
  - on one side have the Toolshelf displayed by 
    hovering within the window and hitting 'T'
  - on the other side display the Properties window 
    likewise, hover, and press 'N'
 
 - Navigating Viewport of 3D View
  - consist of three main operations: orbiting, zooming and panning
  - Orbiting is to move around the object viewing it from 
    different angles from (0,0,0)
  - Zooming moves in an out as you'd expect
  - Panning is to move the viewport position in relation to the 3D 
    axis, do this while holding down Shift and pressing MMB

 - it will only appear in orthogonal view from which it was added
 - while in that view, unchecking the "Background Images" will toggle it
   on and off

Terms
 - Viewport: the manner of viewing a 3D object on a 2D computer screen
 - Data-Block: base unit of any blender project
   - primary blend-file content
   - has discrete list of types (e.g. Lattice, Object, Scene, etc.)
   - are linkable in various arrangements (e.g. parent\child) with modifiers
   - has a unique name within file's context
   - may posses their own animation data
   - have custom properties with various uses

  - Action: containing animation F-Curves
  - Armature: used for skeleton mesh deformations
  - Curve: camera, font and surface data
  - Mesh, which contains an objects vertices, edges & faces
  - Object: scene entity with location, scale & rotation
  - Scene: primary and top-level store of all objects and animation
   - will have min. of Model, Materials and Lights
  - Screen: coupled to each window
  - Text: for py scripts
  - Texture: applied to object's surface for smooth, rough, bumpy, cracked, etc.
  - Material: applied to object's surface for color, reflectiveness, transparency, etc.
  - Lattice: grid-based, invisible area which surrounds the object
 - Color Map: (aka diffuse maps) a kind of texture which gives color and definition 
 - Bump Map: a texture which is used to make a flat surface appear bumpy
 - Normal Maps: also a texture, a more powerful version of a bump map 
   which can be applied onto a 3D model
 - Alpha Maps: a useful texture to create a sense of transparency
 - Specularity Maps: a texture to control the shininess of a model's surface
 - Reflection Maps: a texture for a mirror like surface
 - Illumination Maps: a texture for a light-source and fade
----

----
Mesh
 - the process of taking a mesh primitive and editing it 
   to form more complex shape
 - specific the the aggregate of polygons formed by connected 
   edges and vertices.
 
 - Mesh Primitive: a base, simple shape to begin a mesh from
  - Plane, basic 2D primitive 
  - Cube, the extension of a plane into three dim
  - Icosphere, a sphere made by connecting many triangles
  - UV Sphere, a globe like sphere with poles at top and bottom
  - Torus, a doughnut-shaped primitive

 - Object Mode, moving, resizing, rotating, etc the whole object
 - Edit Mode, dealing with individual vertices, edges and faces of an object

 - Vertices, same meaning as found in Graph Theory (aka nodes, points)
 - Edge, likewise from Graph Theory (aka links, lines)
 - Face, the polygon area enclosed within three or more edges

 - Poles, a vetex connected by three, five or more edges
 - Non-Poles, a vetex connected by one, two or four edges

 - Loops, a range of faces or edges which are connected
 - Cyclic Loops: loops which to not terminate along poles and
   are, therefore, continous.
 - Edge Loop: the loop concept concerning just edges
 - Face Loop: and extension of edge loops to that of faces

 - Selection Mode: the manner of selecting while in Edit Mode
  - a multiple selection is allowed (i.e. edge and face )
  - also mouse-based movements for selecting some range of the mesh
  - advanced selection for edge and face loops is supported

 - Mirroring: by picking one of the three axis the vertices
   are duplicated on the other side 
----

----
Material
 - Surface: concerns the properties of a 3D objects faces
  - Diffuse: the overall color of the surface
   - Intensity: the intensity of the color at the given light-level
     where 0.0 is no light, and 1.0 is max light
   - Ramp: a manner for blending colors as a gradient
  - Specular: the color of the reflection of light off the surface
   - Hardness: a range to spread the specular color across the surface
     where high values focus the reflection to small area while low 
     values spread it wider
  - Transparency: control over how light passes through a surface
  - Mirror: control over the reflectiveness 
 
 - Halo: concerns the properties of the vertices of a 3D object
    displayed as points of light 
----

----
Texture
 - World Textures: for overall scene background
 - Material Texture: for the surface of 3D objects
 - Particle Texture: for use in Blender Particle System
 - Data Texture: used to affect Vertex Paint and Sculpt tools
 - F12 or UV\Image editor window will display an object with Texture applied
----
 
----
Armatures
 - the application of stiff, skeletal, segments to a mesh or other
 
 - Bones: the base element of an armature
  - entities names should have a L\R prefix or suffix with some kind
    of obvious separator (e.g. underscore, dot, dash)
   - this naming convention enables for mirroring bones along an axis
  - Deforming Bones: when transformed, will have assoc. vertices also
    transformed
  - Control Bones: a kind of envelope bone which directes other bones based
    on its state.
  
 - Bone Structure: 
  - consist of Root, Body and Tip
  - root is the starting joint, 
  - body is the segment itself
  - tip is the end joint
 
 - since one bone is, typically, connected to another selecting one's head 
   is another's tip and vice versa
 - Rest Position: the default state of the armature upon which all further
   poses are based
----

----
Character Modeling
 - Model Sheet: for game characters where a front and side perspective
    are literal artworks which are imported into the digital form
    - T-Pose: a model sheet with character arms extended outward perpendicular
      to the floor while the side view has the arms missing
      
 - A Rendering: a name for the final result of an artist converting the 
    original artwork into a useable digital entity.  Sort of like how
    a program is compiled.
    
 - Polygon Count: the total  count of the faces in the mesh
   - lower means less work for hardware
   - a smoothing modifiers will increase this polygon count
   - polygon count is a function of importance, distance and interactivity
   - the limits of the polygon count are derived from the expected underlying
     hardware on which the game is played

 - Model Topology: the arrangement of polygons on 3D models
   - general rules for character-model topology
    - have polygons as rectangles (aka "quads", quadratic)
     - 3D animation programs will distort these properly
    - have three loops for joints on extremities
    - layout facial geometry with loops around openings (e.g. the mouth would
      be circumscribed by a series of three ovals)
 
 - Normals: describe the way that a polygon's visible surface is facing
  - a face in blender is only visable from one side
  - normals may be facing inward or outward
  
 - Smoothing Modifier: an algo applied to a mesh to reduce the 
    appearance of the polygon faces.
   - Blender has builtin called Subdivision Surface modifier
