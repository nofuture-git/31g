Overview
 - an open-source 3D computer graphics software platform
 - uses range from film animation, visual effects, 3D printing
   and video games
 - the abbrev. "UV" is simply to represent its not "XYZ"
 - is designed to be interfaced with one-hand-on-keyboard\one-hand-on-mouse
  - abbrev. for mouse button is LMB (left mouse button) 
    a RMB (right) and (MMB) for middle (MMB is sub'ed with ALT+LMB)
  - RMB is used for selecting items within scene
  - LMB is used for clicking interface options (i.e. context-menu)
  
 - 3D Cursor: a kind of central point for control and placement of objects
 
 - GUI typically windows
  - 3D View: main window, like the code editor in an IDE
  - Outliner: the project view
   - use the numpad (+) and (-) keys to fold\unfold nodes
  - Properties: the properties of whole project
  - Info: the py commands of the various actions 
  
 - Split screen is controlled from top-right corner of 
   3D View (appearing as 3 diagonal lines)  
  - LMB click and drag this to have the same 3D view in two 
    side-by-side windows
  - on one side have the Toolshelf displayed by 
    hovering within the window and hitting 'T'
  - on the other side display the Properties window 
    likewise, hover, and press 'N'
 
 - Navigating Viewport of 3D View
  - consist of three main operations: orbiting, zooming and panning
  - Orbiting is to move around the object viewing it from 
    different angles from (0,0,0)
  - Zooming moves in an out as you'd expect
  - Panning is to move the viewport position in relation to the 3D 
    axis, do this while holding down Shift and pressing MMB

Terms
 - Viewport: the manner of viewing a 3D object on a 2D computer screen
 - Data-Block: base unit of any blender project
   - primary blend-file content
   - has discrete list of types (e.g. Lattice, Object, Scene, etc.)
   - are linkable in various arrangements (e.g. parent\child) with modifiers
   - has a unique name within file's context
   - may posses their own animation data
   - have custom properties with various uses
    - has a name and is assigned a numerical value (bool is 1\0)
    - can specify min\max
    - will be accessed programatically 
  - Action: containing animation F-Curves
  - Armature: used for skeleton mesh deformations
  - Curve: camera, font and surface data

  - Lattice: grid-based, invisible area which surrounds the object
 - Color Map: (aka diffuse maps) a kind of texture which gives color and definition 
 - Bump Map: a texture which is used to make a flat surface appear bumpy
 - Normal Maps: also a texture, a more powerful version of a bump map 
   which can be applied onto a 3D model
 - Alpha Maps: a useful texture to create a sense of transparency
 - Specularity Maps: a texture to control the shininess of a model's surface
 - Reflection Maps: a texture for a mirror like surfacea

 - Unwrap: the concept that if one were to take any 3D image and cut it along
    particular lines (aka Seams) one could unwrap the 3D image into one or more
    2D images- this is the same as in clothing where sheets of flat material 
    are sown together to form a 3D piece of clothing...
----

----
Mesh
 - the process of taking a mesh primitive and editing it 
   to form more complex shape
 - specific the the aggregate of polygons formed by connected 
   edges and vertices.
 
 - Mesh Primitive: a base, simple shape to begin a mesh from
  - Plane, basic 2D primitive 
  - Cube, the extension of a plane into three dim
  - Icosphere, a sphere made by connecting many triangles
  - UV Sphere, a globe like sphere with poles at top and bottom
  - Torus, a doughnut-shaped primitive

 - Object Mode, moving, resizing, rotating, etc the whole object
 - Edit Mode, dealing with individual vertices, edges and faces of an object

 - Vertices, same meaning as found in Graph Theory (aka nodes, points)
 - Edge, likewise from Graph Theory (aka links, lines)
 - Face, the polygon area enclosed within three or more edges

 - Poles, a vetex connected by three, five or more edges
 - Non-Poles, a vetex connected by one, two or four edges

 - Loops, a range of faces or edges which are connected
 - Cyclic Loops: loops which to not terminate along poles and
   are, therefore, continous.
 - Edge Loop: the loop concept concerning just edges
 - Face Loop: and extension of edge loops to that of faces

 - Selection Mode: the manner of selecting while in Edit Mode
  - a multiple selection is allowed (i.e. edge and face )
  - also mouse-based movements for selecting some range of the mesh
  - advanced selection for edge and face loops is supported

 - Mirroring: by picking one of the three axis the vertices
   are duplicated on the other side 
----

----
Material
 - Surface: concerns the properties of a 3D objects faces
  - Diffuse: the overall color of the surface
   - Intensity: the intensity of the color at the given light-level
     where 0.0 is no light, and 1.0 is max light
   - Ramp: a manner for blending colors as a gradient
  - Specular: the color of the reflection of light off the surface
   - Hardness: a range to spread the specular color across the surface
     where high values focus the reflection to small area while low 
     values spread it wider
  - Transparency: control over how light passes through a surface
  - Mirror: control over the reflectiveness 
 
 - Halo: concerns the properties of the vertices of a 3D object
    displayed as points of light 
----

----
Texture
 - World Textures: for overall scene background
 - Material Texture: for the surface of 3D objects
 - Particle Texture: for use in Blender Particle System
 - Data Texture: used to affect Vertex Paint and Sculpt tools
 - F12 or UV\Image editor window will display an object with Texture applied
----
 
----
Armatures
 - the application of stiff, skeletal, segments to a mesh or other
 
 - Bones: the base element of an armature
  - entities names should have a L\R prefix or suffix with some kind
    of obvious separator (e.g. underscore, dot, dash)
   - this naming convention enables for mirroring bones along an axis
  - Deforming Bones: when transformed, will have assoc. vertices also
    transformed
  - Control Bones: a kind of envelope bone which directes other bones based
    on its state.
  
 - Bone Structure: 
  - consist of Root, Body and Tip
  - root is the starting joint, 
  - body is the segment itself
  - tip is the end joint
 
 - since one bone is, typically, connected to another selecting one's head 
   is another's tip and vice versa
 - Rest Position: the default state of the armature upon which all further
   poses are based

Character Modeling
 - general steps being 
  - Modeling
  - Mapping
  - Rigging
  - Animating

 - Model Sheet: for game characters where a front and side perspective
    are literal artworks which are imported into the digital form
    - T-Pose: a model sheet with character arms extended outward perpendicular
      to the floor while the side view has the arms missing
 
 - Modeling: 
  - begins with two side-by-side viewports, one in orthographic x-axis and the
    other in orthographic y-axis.
  - the model sheet is split in two separate files having the front 
    and side view in the same pixel-by-pixel dim's 
  - front view is imported into viewport for ortho-x-axis and side view
    is likewise for ortho-y-axis
  - a Mirror modifier is often applied so the work only relates to one side
    of x-axis
  - modeling takes two general approaches 
   - extruding: given some shape, vertices are extruded in some direction
   - poly-by-poly: drawing by adding polygons to each edge one-at-a-time
  - modeling follows along main body part categories
   - head\neck: typically drawn with poly-by-poly to handle facial features
   - torso\waist: the base extrusion form the original basic shape
   - upper\lower legs: face-delete, followed by extrusion
   - upper\fore arms: likewise as legs
   - hands\feet: duplicate edge loops, making independent geometry, 
      then extrude to form detail
   - eyes: created as independent spheres layered inside the face mesh
       just like eyes in biology
   - mouth: like eyes, being created from a smooth\subdivided cube and 
       layered within the face
  - clothing articles are created by separating parts of the mesh
    and pulling\pushing, folding and extruding as needed
  
  - Mapping:
   - typically involves steps of defining seams and, thereby, 
     2D images (UV Map) followed by the application of sculpted 
     features (Normal Map) and last is the application of 
     color (Color Map)
   - UV Mapping:
    - the effort of grouping polygons of the character's mesh into
     flat 2D parts along particular seams
   - Normal Mapping:
    - for adding high-res detail to low-polygon models
    - used by game engine to display as-though it were a high-polygon model
    - the effort results in a sense of the poloygons surface having
      been sculpted with rich detail (less any color)
    - the file will itself be an image file (i.e. tif, jpeg, png etc.)
   - Color Mapping:
    - uses raster graphics, which are pixel-by-pixel 
     - don't scale as well as vector graphics
     - do provide greater gradient control to color
    - is typically created in a graphics editor (GIMP, Photoshop)
      
  - Rigging:
   - involves linking "bones" to the vertices of a mesh by weight
   - is technical in nature rather than artistic 
   - allows for the application of constraints and interconnected
     association amoung the various bones
    - associations are in the form of parent\child relations
      where movement of a parent cause movement of its children
    - constraints are in the form of allowable range of pivot-points
    - inverse kinematics (IK) allows for a control-point in which
      the bone at the end of a chain will control all above it
    - links can be formed without having bones tail-head directly 
      connected
    - each bone's head is associated to an x-y-z orientation which can be
      rotated
   - linking amoung various programs (e.g. Unity) is formed by 
     a bone naming convention 
    - the convention has a "root" bone which is often situated with
      its head at the navel
    - appendenges will have a L\R or Left\Right suffix
   - bones may be representative, serving the purpose of control over
     whole parts of the armature 
    - these may be situated outside the model
 
  - Animating
   - recorded sequences of discrete armature movements over a time frame
   - requires the rigging is complete and fully painted to the model's mesh
   - typical minimum animations are idle, walk and run
   - forms the interface upon which game engine gains programatic control
     over the character
   - is an artform all on its own
   - the animation is itself one continous sequence so noting the 
     start-stop of each, in terms of particular time-frame value, is 
     required before dropping into Unity
