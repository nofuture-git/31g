general terms
 end-to-end
  - from the source all the way to the dest
 
 link-by-link
  - from one node to the very next 
  - many of these would make up on end-to-end

 protocol family
  - is the stack of communication protocols used
    to transmit across a network

 security service 
  - a quality of a system present to satisfy a security policy
  - identifies <i>what</i> is needed
  
 security mechanism
  - a concrete procedure used to actually implement such a quality
  - describes <i>how</i> to acheive it

 SSL: secured sockets layer  
 
 computationally secure
  - means, in theory, with enough processing power and storage space
    as system could eventually be broken 
  - the eventual may be many times the age of the universe.

 unconditionally secure
  - means no amount of processing could ever crack the 
    cipher text
  
 brute-force attack
  - try every possiable combination of a key to get 
    the cipher-text

 dictionary attack
  - when the secert key is derived from words in 
    the common language 
  - there is a lot less combinations of these
 
 known-plaintext attack
  - the key is unknown but the input (plaintext)
    and output (ciphertext) are known
	
 chosen-plaintext attack
  - the key is unknown, the input (plaintext) is 
    choosen under some reasonable conditions and 
	the output (ciphertext) is known.

authentication
 - assurance for the claimed identity of a user
 - you are who you say your 
 
 claimant
  - a person, program or device whose identity
    is being verified
 
 principal
  - the actual owner of an identity

 credentials 
  - the evidence a claimant presents to est. 
    its identity   

 entity authentication
  - user claims to be a legitimate principal of a system
 
 data origin authentication
  - provide evidence that data originated from a principal
  
 unilateral entity authentication
  - only one party involved authenticates itself
  
 mutual entity authentication
  - both parties authenticate themselves to each other
  - this is like the police asking for id and you asking 
     to see a badge.
	  
 something-you-know
  - claimant presents knowledge
  
 something-you-have
  - claimant demonstrates possession of something-you-have
  
 something-you-are
  - some immutable verifiable trait of a claimant
  
 passwords & pins
  - most common form of authentication, is a 
    something-you-know
  - to be easily memorized have a vowel at 
    every three letters
	
 challenge-response authentication protocol
  - authentication system presents some random value
  - claiment must hash this value with a secert-key
  - claiment presents this hashed value
  
 transformed password protocol
  - claiment must hash thier password first and send
    the hash to the authentication system
	
 one-time password protocol
  - guards against replay attacks
  - starts with a shared, small, secert number (n)
  - claiment hashes password (n) times and presents it
  - with successful authentication (n = n-1)
  - upon reaching zero the password an (n) are reset
  
 digital certificate protocol
  - a variation of challenge-response
----

----
authorization
 - establishes what a user is allowed to do
 - refers to an access-control service
  - access is read, write, execute and device
 - confidentiality: protects against communications
   monitering 
 - integrity: protects against modifications of data
 - nonreudiation: prevents a party involved in communications 
   from later falsely denying having participated.
 - availability: provides the resources are present

cryptography
 
 message-digest algorithms
  - map variable-length plain text 
    to fixed length cipher text 
  - cannot be turned back to plain text
  - is commonly known as hashing
  
 secret key cryptography
  - is symmetric cryptography 
  - is like a decoder ring where the same one used
    to encrypt a message is, in turn, used to decrypt it
  - the following are all kinds of secert keys:
     session key
     content-encryption key
     bulk-encryption key


 cipher: the cryptographic algorithm
  - two kinds of symmetric ciphers
   
   block cipher: operate on discrete blocks of bits (e.g. 64 bits)
   
   stream cipher: operate on one bit at a time
    - having the plain text as the first stream
	- there is a second stream of random bits of the same length
	  known as one-time pad or just pad
	- by index, each of the two are XOR
  
  substitution : substitutes one char for another
	monoalphabetic cipher : the classic decoder ring
	 is a substitution cipher
  
  permutation : is a kind of substitution, where each 
    bit is placed in some other position within a block.

  encryption scheme : this is the manner which some message 
    is encrypted.  
	
	electronic code book: a kind of encryption scheme where 
	  some message is broken into blocks to fit the block 
	  cipher (e.g. 64 bits) where the last one is padded, 
	  considered weak
	  
	cipher block chaining : XOR the current plain text block 
	  with the cipher text of the previous block.
	   
	   initialization vector(IV) : the "cipher text" used 
	    for the first block in a cipher block chaining
	
	output feedback mode : takes a session key, uses it 
	  to generate the second stream in a stream cipher

	   
 public key cryptography : 
  - invented by W.Diffie and M.Hellman in 1975.
  - is asymectric cryptography
   
   public key : used to take plain text to cipher text
   private key : used to take cipher text back to plain
	
 man-in-the-middle attack : if the sender is dupped into
   using an imposters public key then they may, in turn,
   decrypt the message then re-encrypt it with the intended
   recepiant's public key and foward it on.  Neither side
   is aware of the imposter...
   
  hybrid cryptosystems : uses the asymmetric to negotiate 
    a secert-key (symmetric), this is because asymmetric is 
	hundreds of times slower then symmetric.
 
  
 public-key certificate
 - a binding between an entity's public key and one 
   or more attributes or properties related to its identity.
 - asserts that the public key belongs to the entity and 
   that said entity has the corresponding private key

 digital certificate, digital ID, certificate
  - loose synonyms for public-key certificate
 
 certificate subject
  - this is the term for the entity referred\associated
    to the certificate.
  - when the entity is a legal person the 'subject' may
    be referred to as 'subscriber'
	
 RSA - stands for the creators names of Rivest, Shamir and 
       Adleman
 DSA - stands for Digital Signature Algorithm
 
 PKCS - stands for Public-Key Cryptography Standards

 ASN - stands for Abstract Syntax Notation
 
 Digital Signature
  - data item that vouches for the origin and integrity 
    of a message
  - the hash of a message is calc'ed 
  - the private key then encrypts the hash
    - notice that the private key is being 
	  used for encryption in this case
  - the encrypted hash is the digital signature
  - the public key is used to decrypt the signature
  - this produces the supposed hash 
  - the message itself is separately hashed and the
    two should be an exact match

Digital Certificates
 - a cert operates similar to a person's ID (DL, Passport)
  - DL would be useless if everyone could just make thier 
    own.
  - the DL has authority since it was issued by the 
    government
  - just like minors trying to get a case of beer - DL's
    (and certs) must be detectable as forgeries
   - unlike a DL, which is not easy to create, a cert
     is only a chunk of binary data and can be created 
	 very easily.
  - a Certificate Authority is the equivalent of a DMV
 
 X.509 
 - is a standard for of digital certificates
 - contains many parts
 Version 
 Certificate Serial Number
 Signature Algorithm Identifier
  - this would include both the hashing algo 
    and the encryption algo
 Issuer name
  - the CA who issued this certificate
 Validity period
  - a from and to date-time
 Subject
  - the entity the CA issued the 
    cert to
 Public key
  - the digital content of the key
  - also the algorithm
 Thumbprint
  - a hexdecimal value which is 
    more precise than a name.
 extension fields
  - is a dictionary of key value
    pairs 
  - intended for customization
 
 Distinguished Name (DN)
  - a set of name-value pairs
  - a pair is by various chars (CR, LF, ;)
  - the name-value assignment is 
    separated by the '=' sign 
  - common subfields of DN
   C : Country of Origin
   O : Company or organization name
   OU : Organizational unit
   CN : Common name of the user
   L : Locality (often the city's name)
   S : State or province
   T : Titile of person or organization
   GN : given name
   I : a set of initials
   E : email address
   DC : domain component
