 - ISOLINUX std for booting live CD's
 - Qema VM for booting an emulator in MS Windows
 - VMware VM uses VMware to run emulator in MS Windows

Boot Process
 - preliminary
  - need DSL on some media 
   - historically it was a CD-R having the .iso
     burned at the slowest possiable rate (X4)
  - BIOS needs to target the form of media for booting from
  
 - DSL Boot Process is three stages
 (1) Boot Prompt, allows for boot configuartion settings
  - the first screen after computer startup is the boot prompt
  - pressing Enter will take default and proceed to the next step
  - pressing nothing, after 60s, will do the same and proceed onward
  - pressing F2 cancels the 60s timer
  - pressing F3 displays a help menu of boot prompt options
  - multiple options are space-delimited 
  (example)
   dsl vga=normal noapic nacpi pnpbios=off acpi=off noapm
  - to use daemons you must include 'secure' command 
   - you will be prompted to provide a password
  - common daemons are 
   nfs: Network File System
   ssh: Secure Shell
   host: to assign a host name to the running DSL instance
   dma: as speed enhancement for hardware (from year 2000 up)
   lpd: printing service
   cron: scheduled command exec
   syslog: system logging
   monkey: web services
   ftp: file transfer protocol
   fuse: file system in user space

 (2) Autoconfig
  - begins upon pressing Enter in first stage or timer expires
  - typically ends with init. X Window System - the GUI of DSL desktop
  
 (3) DSL X Setup
  - is optional, typically deals with USB mouse or esoteric hardware
  - to exit early, having DSL switch back to defaults, press the Tab key 
    followed by the Enter key
  - oddity, a two-button mouse may be a three button mouse because pressing
    both buttons at-the-same-time IS the third button.
   - the script at /usr/sbin/xsetup.sh is a script to set a two-button
     mouse to have a 'third' button on combo left-right click
	 - requires a restart of X server (?)

Using DSL Fluxbox
 - DSL uses an older graphical toolkit names GTK1.2 instead of current GTK2.0
  - this is deliberate since the older one is faster and lighter
 - the default interface is named Fluxbox 
  - there is a secondary interface named JWM which is more windows-esque
 - mouse-right click is Windows equivalent to the Start button
 - there are 4 workspaces (Fluxter), mouse-wheel will move between them
  - at the bottom-left are four boxes where the highlighted is current 
    workspace 
  - will contain a miniture of open apps within said workspace
 - on hover over app icon - single-left click to run
 - right-click on title-bar opens a window-specific context menu
  - the single '.' button at far-left of title bar will cause said
    app to be present in all four workspaces
  - title-bar buttons on right are common to windows users
 - drag is typical left-click-down and move window app within screen
 - the small tab at the bottom-left of a window's app is for clustering
   apps together - this requires a three button mouse
  - think as if multiple windows of the exact same size are stacked atop 
    each other 
 - small box in lower right corner of workspace is named Docked.lua
  - easy access to volume-control and mounted device
  - click the device name (e.g. hda1, cdrom) to toggle to the next device
   hda is first IDE drive
   hdb is second IDE drive
   sda is first SCSI or USB drive
   sdb is second SCSI or USB drive
  - when numbers appear after a drive name its representative of the partition
  hda1 is first partition of first IDE drive

DSL Backup/Restore
 - DSLpanel > Backup/Restore 
  - enter a mounted device name in textbox
  - saves dir\files specified in .filetool.lst
  - backups are saved to a file that DSL scans for 
    upon boot named backup.tar.gz
 
 - itemized file-by-file backup selected by line item entries
   in /home/dsl/.filetool.lst
 - itemized exclusions are specified in a like-named 
    /home/dsl/.xfiletool.lst 
 - itemized lines includes wildcards
   Cache  (would exclude all files with this name)
   Cache* (would exclude all files starting with this name)
 
 - to directly control with drive DSL scans for backup.tar.gz
   use the boot option (hda2 is an example, actual device name)
     dsl restore=hda2
----

DSL Desktop Options
 - desktop options are persisted to the /home/dsl/.xinitrc file
 - to have terminal apps launched upon startup edit the 
   /home/dsl/.bash_profile and then add this file to your 
   backup list at /home/dsl/.filetool.lst
  
 - root menu > Desktop > Icon Tool allows for custom setting on
   how\what click do on the desktop
  - contains four bottom tabs, 
  - using Double-Click means should be coupled with 
    Layout > Use X/Y Coordinates since first click is select icon
	and second click is open app.
  - Add tab requires the path to the app and some generic icon 
  - Remove tab allows for removing icons from your desktop
  - these settings are persisted to /home/dsl/.xtdesktop
 - root menu > Desktop > Wallpapers allows for custom desktop backgrounds
  - radio-button Scale, Emblem are how to display the image 
  - OK button will temp display it as such
  - Install button will persist the selected background
  - Help button shows where image are stored

  - will launch and attempt to connect to wired connection
  - wired connections will typically be detected automatically
 
 - Wireless connection
  - first requires the boot option nodhcp
  - the wireless setup is persisted to the /opt directory
  http:/www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/index.php/Verified_Wireless_Cards
   - contains a list of wireless network cards that will work with DSL
  - Iwconfig, Prism2 and Wlanconfig are tools avaliable at the DSLpanel
    for setup of wireless connection
  - Ndiswrapper lets you provide a windows driver for your wireless card
  http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List
   - is a good source for selecting a Windows driver for your wireless card
  - These apps are for older wireless connections
