I forgot to mention, when a DNSname is created, normally an additional pointer(PTR) record gets created to facilitate reverse lookups.
Occasionally, for various reasons, the PTR record does not get created, so a reverse lookup would fail, until someone rebuilds a PTR record for the desired address.
If a reverse lookup fails, you could at least try a ping x.x.x.x to see if the address is valid, it just would not be known to DNS.
 
You can also do a ping with the "a" option to see if a DNS name gets resolved.
