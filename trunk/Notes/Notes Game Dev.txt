Technical Terms:
 - Game Design -vs- Game Development: design is consideration of 
    the whole while development is typically the technical code-part
 - Toys, Puzzles, Games - the subject of Play 
 - Play: wide category of nonessential, and usually recreational,
         human activities that are often socially significant
    - Participatory Play: is Play in which one participates meaning
       one has the freedom to choose how to act 
    - Passive Play: is Play in which one is an audience member
 - Pretending: is the mental ability to est. an imaginary reality
 - Rules: instructions about how to Play
  - Toys are not bound by rules
 - Goal: a particular objective of the play
  - A Toy becomes a Puzzle when a Goal is added
 - Game: a type of Play, conducted in the context of a 
    Pretended reality, in which participant(s) try
    to achieve a Goal in accordance with the Rules
   - differs from the formal Game Theory of Mathematics
     because conflict is not essential
 - Victory Condition: an unambiguous situation in which
     one or more players are declared the winner.
 - Termination Condition: a situation in which the game 
     is over.
    - in racing games, coming first is the victory while
      having all players cross finish line is termination 
      condition
 - Loss Condition: a kind of victory where the goal is to 
     continue the longest without losing
 - Magic Circle: another name for the pretended reality
     of a game.
 - Perfect Information: a game that has no hidden info and 
    no element of chance 
 - Game Genre: categorization by the particular kinds of 
    challenge - independent of pretended world
 - Exclusionary Material: content or features that serve
    to drive players away from a game the they may otherwise
    have liked.
----

----
Rules Define:
 - Semiotics: rules est. meaning and relationship amoung 
    the various symbols used in the game.
 - Gameplay: the Challenges the game offers a player
 - Game-Sequence: the progression of activities 
 - Victory Condition
 - Termination Condition
 - Metarules: rules about the rules
----

----
Challenges
 - Any nontrivial task set for a player to accomplish.
 - Must involve some form of effort
 - Are defined by the Rules
 - Take three typical forms
  - Unique: like the Boss fight
  - Recurring: like recurrent identical enemies
  - Continuing: like maintaining heath
----

----
Actions
 - The Rules about what a player may do to overcome
    challenges
 - Are finite in a game environment since the computer
    host is a finite machine
----

----
Gameplay
 - composition of Challenges and Actions
 - Symmetric Gameplay: where the game begins at a state 
    in which all players have an equal chance of winning
 - Asymmetric Gameplay: different players may play by different
    rules to achieve different victory conditions
 - Competitive Gameplay: players attempting to accomplish 
     mutually exclusive goals
 - Cooperative Gameplay: players attempt to achieve the same
     goal by working together
----

----
Fairness
 - a value judgment of a player on how well the actions
   address the challenges
 - of particular importance to video games since players
   cannot change the rules
----

----

----

----
Immersion
 - gameplay in which the player looses track to the 
   outside world
 - Tactical: high-speed gameplay made up of many small 
    and similar challenges
 - Strategic: deep involvement in winning by making forward
    thinking optimal choices
 - Spatial: being involved in a rich 3D world
 - Narrative: being inside the story
----

----
Emotional Resonance
 - The emotions a designer wants their players to feel
  1 Amusement: funny
  2 Contentment: fulfilling, satisfaction
  3 Wonderment: amazed
  4 Excitement: a rush
  5 Curiosity: 
  6 Triumph: overcome adversity
  7 Surprise: startling, frightening
  8 Naches: happiness at seeing children\students grow
  9 Relief: survival 
  10 Bliss: joyfulness
----

----
Key Components
 - Core Mechanics: the compiled code
 - User Interface: mediates between core mechanics and player
   - typical software is not supposed to present challenges 
  - is subdivided into:
   - Camera Model: the user interface displayed from a particular
      angle or point-of-view
   - Interaction Model: turns the players inputs into actions within
      the game world
----

----
Gameplay Modes
 - Gameplay Modes are typically a graph structure - the 
    current mode determines what modes may follow (like graph theory's 
    vertices and edges)
 - Shell Menus: are the gameplay modes which typically 
    involve the environment settings (loading, saving, 
    setting volume\resolution)
   - Shell Screens: are the non-interactive sequences such
      as the title screen & credits
 - Game Structure: the total aggregate of Gameplay Modes and Shell Menus
 - a video game is always in either a gameplay mode or a shell menu
----

----
Game Design
 - is an abstract concept separate from any particular kind of game
 - is subdivided into three main stages
  1 Concept Stage
  2 Elaboration Stage
  3 Tuning Stage
 - text recommendations:
  - team governance suffers the same problems as all governance 
   - one designer should have executive authority over decisions 
   - should be neither autocratic nor democratic
  - a design decision should be explicit to the point that a coder
    is only left determining the "how" and not the "what"
----

---- 
Concept Stage 
 - a stage whose decisions define all that follows
 - these decisions are therefore permanent
 - Game Concept: a general idea of how to entertain through gameplay
 - Target Audience: given the concept this follows concerning who 
    would enjoy such gameplay
 - Player's Role: determining the position of a player in the gameplay's 
    concept.
----

----
Elaboration Stage
 - this stage is iterative in which the bulk of coding and art 
    are given form
 - Preproduction Stage: borrowed concept from film industry where
    some kind of working example is made which is used to secure 
    funding from a publisher
 - Prototyping: another name for the above specifically being the
    a concrete working example of the concept and gameplay thereof
   - Paper Prototype: demo'ing the game in terms of a board game 
 - Primary Gameplay Mode: the gameplay mode in which a player spends
    the majority of their time.
 - Protagonist Design: must be defined early to give sense to the 
    imaginative process of gameplay
 - Game World Design: the world in which the game takes place
 - Core Mechanics Design: these only have sense once the challenges\actions
    have been given some definition
 - Additional Modes Design: other modes which will be required to connect
    the Game Structure together
 - Level Design: the direct platform on which testing is conducted and 
    from which game progression is made
 - Iterate: the typical dev cycle of buid-test-repeat
----

----
Tuning Stage
 - the final stage a which no more features are added
 - consist in fine-tuning the overall balance of the game
   and defect fixes
 - is subtractive not additive just as polishing removes 
   imperfections
----

----
Team Roles
 - industry does not have definitive names for these and may 
   vary from shop-to-shop
 - Lead Designer: oversees the overall design and insures it 
    is complete and coherent
 - Mechanics Designer: defines and documents the core mechanics
 - UI Designer: responsible for the layout of a gameplay's screen
    and the function of the input devices
 - Level Designer: define the course of the game in terms of
    the core mechanics, UI and gameplay
 - Writer: are responsible for intro material, back story, dialogue,
    cut-scenes - these may be offloaded to a freelance writer
 - Art Director: manages all visual assets of a game including
    the models, textures, sprites, animations, UI elements, etc.
 - Audio Director: manages all the audio assets of a game including
    the music, ambient sounds, effects, dialogue or narration
 - Lead Programmer: oversees the coding team, technical design and 
    software quality
 - Producer (Product Manager): responsible for the game as a 
    commercial product

VandenBerghe's Five Domains of Play
 - modeled on the Big Five Personality Trait model in psy
 - express the reason players play based on personality traits
 O: is Novelty, wanting new variety over sameness
 C: is Challenge, require precision to win over fooling around
 E: is Stimulation, wanting multiplayer games over single player
 A: is Harmony, particular social harmony over straight competitiveness
 N: is Threat, seeking games that scare
