Windows CLI Reference
 
 arp -a    will list IP's to MAC address
 assoc     will print all file extensions and file types
 ftype     will print the 'assoc's names to actual cmd lines
  - used together would look something like
  assoc .myExt=MyApp.MoreName 
  ftype MyApp.MoreName=C:\Somewhere\MyApp.exe %1 %*

 compact (/c | /u) FileName
  - /c for compress, /u for uncompress
  - file name may be whole directory or a wild-card pattern
