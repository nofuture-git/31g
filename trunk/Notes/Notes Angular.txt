----
Angular versioning
 - uses the standard version numbers
  - major
  - minor
  - patch
  - build-number
----

----
Runtime dependencies
 - node.js
  - get the installed version of node using
  node -v
 - npm
  - get the installed version of npm using  
  npm -v 
 - Angular CLI
  - install Angular CLI using npm
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  - get the installed version of angular cli using
  ng version
----

----
Angular CLI common commands
 - creates, deploys, adds, etc. to angular projects
 - uses working directory as location
 - is invoked from cmd line as 'ng' space and:
   new : creates new project
   build : transpiles a project
   generate : creates new files for a project
   serve : builds and serves a project from a pre-configured web server
   test : runs unit tests on a project
   deploy : deploys a project to a web-host provider
   add : installs third-party lib's 
   update : updates Angular and dependencies to the latest

----
Core Project file structure
 - core\main files
  ~/src/app/app.component.ts
  ~/src/index.html
  ~/src/app.module.ts
  ~/src/main.ts

  - the whole of what is rendered is within the <body> tag
  - a module is a collection of components 
   - a module's components is listed in its 'declarations' array
  
  - html tag with uncommon names (e.g. app-root) are assumed 
    to be components with matching 'selector' values
  - going from unknown-tag-name to component, the component has a
    'template' which is html content
  - a template allows for interpolation using double-curly braces
  - the name within the double-curly will be declared in the component
  
  - main.ts is the 'main(string[] args)' kind of bootstrap starting place
    for the entire application

----
Component basics
 - components are the main building block
 - components control views
 - components can be generated from the CLI
  - the command is given while working directory is 
    top-of-app (i.e. ~/), angular CLI adds it to the 
    proper place in the folder structure
  ng generate component myNameHere
 
 - the component is contained in its own folder
 - the CLI command adds the new component to the 
   AppModule declarations
  - this the place where components are grouped 
    into modules
 - the folder contains four systematic named files
   with different extensions
  - paths appear as:
  ~/src/app/myNameHere/myNameHere.component.*
  
  - .html is the template
  - .ts is the component's class
  - .spec.ts are unit tests
  - .css is the style sheet
  
 - a TypeScript class becomes an Angular component
   through the use of the @Component decorator
  - the @Component decorator provides three property
    values:
    selector: the id-name used inside of HTML
    templateUrl: the relative path to the HTML file
    styleUrls: an array of relative paths to css files

----
Passing data down to component
 - rough example, define actual value in AppComponent 
 export class AppComponent {
  someAlias = "Some value";
 }

 - next is AppComponent's template .html
 <my-component-name [nameOfInputProperty] = "someAlias"></my-component-name>
 
 - next is on my-component-name.ts 
  - need to import 'Input' from angular core
 import {Input} from '@angular/core';
 
  - then add a public property decorated with @Input
 @Input() public nameOfInputProperty: string = '';
 
  - last is to use the property in my-component-name's template (i.e. html)
 <p>{{nameOfInputProperty}} is here!</p>
----

----
Passing event up to component
 - first define the output on my-component-name's TypeScript class
 - again import the dependencies 
 import { Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
 
 - and add the decorated property to the class
 @Output() public liked = new EventEmitter();
 
 - next, in  my-component-name's template (i.e. html), add a web-forms 
   button whose click event is wired into the 'emit()' method of 
   the EventEmitter named 'liked'
 <button (click)="liked.emit()">Like</button>
 
 - next, in the my-component-name node, present within the
   app.component.html, tie the EventEmitter property of my-component-name
   to a method on app.component.ts class named 'onLike()'
  <my-component-name [nameOfInputProperty] = "someAlias" (liked)="onLike()">
  </my-component-name>
  
 - last, have the event handler in app.component, here named 'onLike' do something
 public onLike(){ console.log("on like event received."); }
----   

----
HTML string interpolation
 - various ways to achieve 
 - typical is double-curly within the inner text\xml of a node
  <span>{{title}}</span>
  
 - square-braces are used to access properties of the 
   HTML (think XML) node 
   <p [style.color]="'greenyellow'"></p>
