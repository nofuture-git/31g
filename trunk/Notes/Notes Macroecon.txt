Notes Macroeconomics

----
Preliminary notes: measurement of the macroeconomic variables.
 - Expenditure Approach  Y = C + I + G + NX
  - Y is total output of the economy
  - C is consumption of 
   - consumer durables (cars televisions furniture but NOT 
     houses they are considered investments)
   - Nondurable goods (food clothing and fuel)
   - Services (education, health care, financial services and transportation)
  - I Investment 
   - Fixed investment ( spending by business on new structures and equipment)
   - Inventory investment ( increase in the available inputs of a firm to 
     produce its product)
  - G Government Purchases 
   - Gov’t purchases on goods and services ( most of which is spent at 
     the state and local level)
   - Transfers which are the money dished out for Social Security, 
     medical aid, unemployment checks and welfare.
  - NX Net Exports: exports minus imports
----

Savings: 
 - Private disposable income: equal to all the income gathered form 
   the private sector plus the money transferred from the government.  
   Amount of money the private sector has to spend.
  - PVT_DI = Y + NFP + TR + INT – T (NFP: net factor payments, which are 
    interest and dividends, paid on foreign assets.  TR: transfers from 
    the government  and INT is interest)

 - Net Government income: this is the amount that is not disposable to 
   the private sector
  - NET_GOVT_INCOME = T – TR – INT  (Which is the governments income, taxes, 
    minus the two major expenditures of the government which is transfers 
    (TR) and interest (INT)).

 - Private Savings: as would be expected the saving of the private sector is 
   their income minus the amount of that income that they use for consumption.
  - S_PVT = PVT_DI – C (Which just states mathematically what was said above)
  - Note that Investment is not included in this formula because it is not 
    something that is used to meet current needs, investment is used to increase 
    productivity in the future.

 - Government Savings: the same principle applies to the government saving as 
   the private.  The governments saving is its income minus the amount that is 
   consumes (G).
  - S_GOVT = (T – TR – INT) – G (note: the first part in parentheses is 
    government income)

 - National Savings: is the sum of Government and private savings
  - S = S_PVT + S_GOVT
  - Note that the above equation reduces to S = Y + NFP – C – G
  - Uses of private savings: the uses of private savings are found algebraically.  
    By replacing Y with the identity (C + I + G + NX) and reducing the equation 
    S = I + (NX + NFP) is found.  With this equation NX + NFP is the Current Account 
    Balance.  Then by subtracting S_GOVT from both sides the Uses-of-savings identity   
    S_PVT = I + CA – S_GOVT
  - I : Investment which is firms borrowing from savers to finance capital investments 
    and increase inventories. 
  - S_GOVT : This is the government budget deficit is must borrow money to cover 
    its spending over its income
  - CA: Current account balance, this is important to international economics, if the 
    CA is negative then the ( as it is in the US) then to finance the deficit the 
    domestic assets must be sold to foreigners in the form of stocks and real assets 
    or the deficit is financed through domestic citizens borrowing from the other country.

 - National Wealth: this is a stock, it has two parts (1) the stock of capital and land 
   in the country and (2) the Net Foreign Assets.  NFA is a country’s foreign assets 
   owned by domestic citizens minus the domestic assets owned by foreigners.  
  - National Wealth may increase by two ways (1) it may increase by an appreciation or 
    depreciation of the current stock, or (2) wealth may grow by an increased savings rate.

Price Index: each year with the expenditure approach the data on total output is in nominal 
 terms.  There is a need to take out the changes of the output data that are a result of 
 increasing prices (inflation) from actual real increases in output.
 - Calculation of real value of output: to get this you must take a base-year’s prices 
   times the current quantities of production
 - Price level changes are calculated in two forms, the difference between the two is 
   in which years output is used. 
  - Fixed-weight index: with this price index the output that is used is the base year.  
                        The only thing that changes from year to year is the current prices 
                        of the market basket
   - PRICE_LEVEL = Q_B * C_P / Q_B * C_B where Q_B is quantity of the base year, C_P is 
                   the current price of the market basket and C_B is the price of the market 
                   basket in the base year.
  - Variable-weight index: with this index the output changes to reflect current levels 
   - PRICE_LEVEL = Q_C * C_P / Q_C * C_B where Q_C quantity at current levels

Inflation: this is measured on a year to year basis by taking the change in the price level 
 of the current year from the previous year and dividing that difference by the previous 
 years price level.

Productivity, Output and Employment:  

Production Function: this is a general equation that states that the output of 
 an economy is a function of capital, labor and productivity.  
 
Capital and labor are the exogenous variables and productivity is the efficiency of the two.
 - The production function is a multivariate function, with both variables showing diminishing 
   marginal productivity.  From this diminishing productivity the derivatives of the two have 
   a negative slope.
 
Labor Demand: As with firm specific, labor demand is found by equating the wage to the 
              marginal product of labor (the derivative of the production function with respect 
              to labor holding capital constant).
 - Capital is considered constant in the short run, therefore in the short-run output is a 
   function of labor alone.
 - With the labor demand function the wage rate is the exogenous variable.  Since the marginal 
   product of labor is negative slope as wage decreases labor demand will go up and the 
   opposite for when the wage goes up.
 - Shifts in the labor demand will happen when there is a change in productivity and 
   or a change in the capital stock. Furthermore, the extent of these changes is known 
   by the values of the production function.  
 
Labor Supply: households and individuals that decide on a tradeoff between labor supply 
              and leisure determine labor supply. Of course the labor supply curve is upward 
              sloping since households are willing to supply more at higher wages.  
 - Wealth: assuming a fixed utility function as wealth increases households will supply 
           less labor at any given wage rate since they can afford more leisure (WPO [FRB\US]).
 - Expected future real wage: if a households expects their future real wage to go up 
                              they will supply less labor now.
 - Working age population: this is simply a higher aggregate supply at any given wage.  
                           This effect will shift the labor supply to the left.
 - Participation Rate: this is assuming that outside the a changing wage rate more people 
                       want to work (LFPR [FRB\US]).
 
Labor Market Equilibrium: Simple statics analysis, by equating labor supply to labor demand 
                          the wage rate is found (LF [FRB\US]).  
 - Full employment output: this is the output that is made when the labor market is in 
                           equilibrium.  The market determines the equilibrium wage rate and at 
                           this wage rate a certain value of labor supply is given (known as full 
                           employment level of employment).By plugging in this labor input with 
                           constant capital and productivity then the output in the short-run is 
                           known.
 - Any shifts that occur due to either supply or demand will change the full employment level.
----

----
Consumption Savings and Investment: 
Consumption and Savings: given a certain income the choice on how much to consume and the how 
                         much to save are one in the same question.  
 - Income: given a current income consumers decide on a desired level of consumption and savings 
  - S_D = Y – C_D – G (where S_D is desired saving and C_D is desired consumption) 
          XB - EC - (EGF + EGS) [FRB\US]
  - Note that both saving and consumption will increase with increases in income
  - As income rises the sum of consumption and saving rises exactly equal.  The proportion 
    of a rise in income that goes to consumption can be found through a regression of consumption 
	to output.  Where the beta value is the marginal propensity to consume.
 - Expected future income: when future expected income rises current income shifts more towards 
   consumption and away form savings, this is because less saving is needed now to meet consumption 
   needs in the future.
 - Wealth: similar to expected future income, when wealth rises there are less liabilities to 
           assets therefore there is less need to save. 
 - Expected real interest rate: an ambiguous effect since higher rates now means more money gives 
                                even more return, however is only a certain value of money is desired 
                                in the future less savings are needed now to meet that future need.
 - Taxes on interest rate gains: Since the effect of interest rates is ambiguous on savings so is 
                                 the taxes on interest rate gains on savings
 - Government purchases: since the government must finance all expenditures through taxes, if taxes 
                         remain the same while the government budget increases then this increase must 
                         be met by higher taxes in the future.  Therefore the aggregate of saving and 
                         consumption will fall by the equivalent increase in the government budget 
 - Taxes: same thing. If the budget remains fixed while taxes fall then a tax increase can be expected 
          in the future. However, if consumers are aware that taxes will need to be raised in the 
          future to meet the new deficit they will save more if they are unaware of this then their 
          savings will remained unchanged.

Investment: derived from similar reasoning as labor demand.  By taking the derivative of the production 
            function with respect to capital while holding labor constant the marginal product of 
			capital is found. 
 - The User Cost of Capital is similar to the wage rate in the labor market in that it equates the 
   desires capital stock that a firm wishes to have.  User cost of capital is determined by 
  - The price of the capital 
  - The Depreciation rate of the capital 
  - The interest rate ( or the rate at which the money must be borrowed at)
  
 - The user cost of capital will shift if:
  - the interest rate changes 
  - there is a change in productivity.
  - The user cost of capital must be discounted to the effective tax rate, therefore any increase in 
    the tax rate will cause the user cost to shift up.
	
 - Actual investment is equal to net investment and replacement investment.
  - Net investment is the difference between the desired capital stock and the current capital stock 
  - Replacement investment is the amount of investment that is needed to replace the capital that 
    has depreciated.
 - Total macroeconomic investment: recall that total investment is the aggregate of fixed investment 
   (discussed above), inventory investment, and residential investment.  However, the principles 
   discussed for coming to a conclusion on fixed investment are the same for coming to conclusions 
   of inventory and residential investment.

Good Market Equilibrium: this is equilibrium when the total amount of goods produces is equal to the 
                         desired consumption, desired investment and government purchases (which are 
						 always assumed to equal their desired levels).  Note that this condition is 
						 different from the expenditure identity, which always hold true.  The 
						 difference comes from the fact that what is actual and what is desired 
						 can differ.
 - Y = C_d + I_d + G  (where C_d is desired consumption and I_d is desired investment).
 - I_d = Y – C_d – G  (This is the same equation only solved for I_d)
 - S_d = Y – C_d – G 
 - Therefore the good market equilibrium can be written as S_d = I_d.
 - The goods market is brought into equilibrium by the interest rate.  This assumes that as the interest 
   rate rises households save more, this is not proven theoretically only empirically.

Savings and Investment in an Open Economy: 
Balance of Payments Accounting: any transactions that involves a flow of funds into the domestic 
                                country is a credit and any transaction that involves a flow of 
								fund out of the domestic country is a debit.
 - Current account: deals only with 
  - currently produced goods and services 
  - investment income such as dividends, interest payments and royalties 
  - Net unilateral transfers or free money.
 - Current account balance is all the credits and debits added together.
 - Capital Account: deals only with existing assets either real of financial and the Official 
                    Reserve Assets held by the central banks of nation-states.
 - Capital Account Balance is all the credits and debits added up.
 
Relationship of Current Account and Capital Account: the capital account and current account 
                                                     must sum to zero.  Since domestic currency 
													 is no good in a foreign country it must be 
 - Used to buy domestic goods or services (CA)
 - Used to buy domestic assets (KA)
 - Exchanged for foreign currency (Official reserve assets)
 
Net Foreign Assets: this is difference between a country’s holding of foreign assets minus its 
                    foreign liabilities.  A country’s net foreign assets can increase by:
 - The value of its current holding appreciating 
 - Acquire more assets by running a current account surplus.
 
Increases in the net foreign assets are done through increases in the capital account.  The 
 difference being that net foreign assets is a stock while the capital account is a flow variable.

Goods Market Equilibrium in an Open Economy: the equilibrium is found by having desired national 
                                             saving equal to desired national investment and the 
											 current account surplus (or money that can be used 
											 to increase net foreign assets).
 - S_d = I_d + CA
 - S_d = I_d + (NX + NFP)  (note the current account surplus is when exports exceeds imports and 
                            factor payment paid out (interest, dividend and royalties) is less 
							than factor payment in).
 - Furthermore, NFP is always a very small number and is therefore eliminated from the equation 
   leaving S_d = I_d + NX (where NX is the same a CA)

Savings and Investment is a Small Open Economy: in a small open economy the interest rate is fixed 
                                                since a small nation cannot effect the world interest 
												rate. Therefore, given an interest rate if saving is 
												greater then investment the country will have a current 
												account surplus, which will be used to increase net 
												foreign assets. 
Savings and Investment in a Large Open Economy: in this case the interest rate in not fixed since changes 
                                                in desired savings and investment will and does effect 
												the world interest rate.  In this case the equilibrium 
												rate that bring the goods market equilibrium is one in 
												which a current account surplus (deficit) in the domestic 
												country equals the current account deficit (surplus) 
												for the rest of that country’s trading partners.

Assets Market: 
Money demand: the demand for money is determined by three parameters.
 - Price Level: as the price level increases money demand increases in proportion
 - Real Income: as real income increases money demand increases, however, money demand does not increase 
                in a 1:1 proportion for increases in real income.  Money demand increases less than the 
				proportional increase in real income.
 - Interest Rate: assuming that there is only one interest rate for non-monetary assets then as the 
                  interest rate increase money demand decreases since the cost of holding money has 
				  increased.

Other Parameters:
 - Wealth: as wealth increases more of that wealth will be held as money.
 - Risk: if risk increases on non-monetary assets then money demand will increase, however if unexpected 
         inflation increases then money demand will fall.
 - Liquidity of non-monetary assets: if the liquidity of non-monetary assets increases then money demand 
                                     will fall, since money is desired for its liquidity as a trade-off 
									 for a zero return.
Elasticities of Money Demand: these are the actual strengths of the changes in real income and the 
                              interest rate on the demand for money.
 - Income Elasticity of money demand: studies have shown this to be around +.66, which 
                                      reflects the prediction of the theory.
 - Interest Elasticity of money demand: studies have shown this to be around -. 15.
 
Note to use these values you must take the percentage increase in one of the variables times 
 these values to get an expected percentage increase in money demand.
----

----
Asset Market Equilibrium: this equilibrium is established by assuming that there are two types 
                          of assets that the total economy can hold, monetary and non-monetary.  
						  Therefore, the decision on how much money to hold is the same as the 
						  decision of how much non-monetary assets to hold.  
 - Total Money demand plus total non-monetary asset demand equals total wealth of the economy.
 - The difference between money demand and money supply plus the difference between non-monetary 
    demand and non-monetary supply should add to zero in an equilibrium.  Furthermore, for both 
	to sum to zero, each must therefore sum to zero.  Meaning the asset market is in equilibrium 
	when money supply equals money demand.
 - Algebraically:
  - M_d +NM_d = W
  - M + NM = W
  - (M_d – M ) + (NM_d + NM) = 0
  - M_d – M = 0

Asset Market Equilibrium Condition: This is simply the equation for money demand.

M/P = L(Y, r + expected inflation) (where M equals M_d in Asset Market Equilibrium, L means 
       M/P is a function of Y and expected inflation and M/P is the real money supply ).
 - M: this is set by the central bank 
 - Expected inflation is considered a fixed parameter.
 - Y: is known by the labor market equilibrium condition, namely as full-employment level of output.
 - r: is known by the asset market equilibrium.
 
Since everything but P is known for the asset market equilibrium, P becomes the endogenous variable 
 that brings the asset market into equilibrium given the values of all the exogenous variables and 
 the values of the fixed parameters.
 
P = M / L( Y, r + expected inflation)
 - This condition states that the price level is equal to the nominal money supply divided by the real 
   demand for money.  Furthermore the real demand for money is fixed in the long-run since both the 
   labor market and goods market are in equilibrium.  Therefore the price level is proportional to the 
   nominal money supply.  Any amount that the nominal money supply increases in the long-run will have 
   an exact proportional increase in the price level.
 
Money Growth and Inflation: the inflation rate is equal to the difference between the growth in the 
                            nominal money supply and the growth in the real demand for money.  
 - Since nominal money growth is decided by the central bank, the focus is on the growth in the real 
   money demand.  By proving that with a constant growth of money the nominal interest rate will 
   be constant.
 - Therefore, inflation can be expected to equal the difference in the growth rate of the nominal 
   money supply minus the product of the growth rate of real income and the income elasticity of 
   money demand.
 - With a constant growth of the nominal money supply the nominal interest rate will be constant.  
   This is because the nominal interest rate is the sum of the real interest rate and the expected 
   inflation.  The real interest rate is constant if the goods market is in equilibrium; furthermore, 
   the expected inflation rate is derived from the increase in the nominal money supply, if it is 
   increasing at a constant rate then the inflation can also be expected to increase at a constant rate.
   
Business Cycles: total market movements a wide array of economic indicators
 - Fluctuations of aggregate economic activity, not just GDP must be interpreted to see business cycles
 - Expansions and Contractions are the basic movements of the business cycle 
 - Comovement is the fact that all the aggregate economic indicators move in the same direction in 
   a business cycle.
 - Business cycles are recurrent, but not periodic.
 
Indicators: all economic indicators are sorted by their direction and timing in reference to 
            the business cycle.
 - Industrial Production: is a procyclical and coincident variable 
 - Consumption: is procyclical and coincident variable.
 - Business Fixed Investment: is procyclical and coincident variable.
 - Residential Investment: is procyclical and leading variable.
 - Inventory investment: is procyclical and leading variable.
 - Average Labor Productivity: is a procyclical and leading variable.
 - Stock prices are procyclical and a leading variable.

IS-LM-FE Macroeconomic Model: with this graph output is on the x-axis and the interest rate is on the y-axis.  
                              What this model does is make interrelations among the three major markets.  
							  Furthermore, each of the three lines represents an equilibrium condition of the 
							  three markets.  Where IS is the equilibrium condition of the goods market 
							  (namely Investment equals savings).

FE Line: this is the labor market equilibrium line or the total output of the economy holding capital and 
         productivity constant.  By placing full-employment level of output (Y) on the graph the FE line 
		 is vertical since the full-level of output is unrelated to the interest rate.
 - Shifts in the FE line will happen when things that effect the production function change or changes in 
   labor supply.
  - Productivity
  - Capital Stock
  - Labor Supply
  
IS Line: this is the line of goods and services market equilibrium. This line has a negative slope because 
         as the output increases, income increases, which mean higher savings, holding the propensity to 
		 consume constant.  However, investment decisions are unrelated to output.  Therefore as output 
		 increases the savings line in the goods market will shift outward and thereby lower the interest 
		 rate. Increasing output by a given value will shift the saving curve by a given value and the market 
		 clearing interest rate will change by a given value.  The IS line show only the affect of the first 
		 factor on the last, namely the change in output to the change in the goods market clearing interest 
		 rate.  
 - Shifts in the IS line:
  - Expected Future Output (Income) [increase]: shifts the IS curve up (to the right).  This is a change in 
                                                the Marginal Propensity to Consume given the same output 
												(income) levels.
  - Wealth [increase]: shifts the IS curve up.  A reduction in the liabilities and therefore a decrease 
                       in the marginal propensity to save.
  - Government Purchases [increase]: shifts the IS curve up.  At a constant output, when government purchases 
                                     increase the change must be met by a decrease in desired national 
									 savings (S_d = Y – C_d – G). 
  - Taxes [increase]: shifts the IS curve down or no change.  If consumers are aware that increased taxes now 
                      will be met with a proportional tax cut in the future then there is no effect on desired 
					  national savings.  If consumers do not have such awareness then the tax increase will 
					  cause the IS curve to shift down (to the left).
  - Marginal Product of Capital [increase]: shifts the IS curve up.  This caused desired national investment 
                                            to increase at all levels.
  - Taxes on Capital [increase]: shift the IS curve down.  This means a higher user cost at all levels 
                                 of investment.
								 
LM Line: this line refers to the asset market equilibrium.  This line has a positive slope meaning that as 
         output goes up a higher interest rate is needed to clear the market.  
 - Preliminary: the price of non-monetary assets has a negative correlation to the interest rate.  For example 
                a zero coupon bond that is worth 1000 in a year and that is trading at 950 now is yielding 5% 
				if the price falls 925 then the yield goes up to 8%.  Therefore there is negative relation to 
				the yield of non-monetary assets and the price of those assets.  
 - Recall that when the Money Supply equals the Money Demand the asset market is in equilibrium.  Furthermore, 
   the money supply is fixed by the central bank and money demand is a function of output.  So as output rises 
   the demand for money rises (since more money is needed for transactions).  To satisfy the increased demand 
   for money consumers and business sell their non-monetary assets.  With the increased supply of non-monetary 
   assets the prices fall and therefore the yield’s (interest rates) rise.  This brings the money demand equal 
   to money supply.  
  
 - Shifts in the LM Line:
  - Nominal Money Supply [increase]: shifts the LM curve down (to the right).  This causes the real money supply 
                                     to increase and lowering the equilibrium interest rate at all levels.
  - Price Level [increase]: shifts the LM curve up (to the left).  This causes the real money supply to decrease 
                            and lowers the equilibrium interest rate at all levels.
  - Expected Inflation [increase]: shifts the LM curve down (to the right).  Business and consumers wish to hold 
                                   less money do to its depreciating value.
  - Nominal interest rate on money [increase]: shifts the LM curve up.  Money becomes more attractive relative 
                                               to non-monetary assets.
  - Wealth [increase]: shifts the LM curve up. 
  - Risk on non-monetary assets [increase]: shifts the LM curve up.
  - Decline in the liquidity of non-monetary assets [increase] shifts the LM curve up.
  
Price Adjustment and Attainment of General Equilibrium: with the IS-LM model the short run output occurs were 
                                                        IS = LM line.
														
To come to an analysis of the effects of a changing variable on the state of the economy some basic points 
 to be looked at first
  - Desired National Savings [ Goods market supply side]
  - Desired National Investment [ Goods Market Demand side]
  - Labor Supply [ Output supply side]
  - Labor Demand [ Output demand side]
  - Productivity [ Output]
  - Money Demand [ Asset market demand side]
  - Money Supply [ Asset market supply side]
 - Increases in the real money supply will cause output to rise and the interest rate to fall.  However, in 
   the long-run, assuming the economy was in a general equilibrium state before the real money supply 
   increase, desired demand for goods will exceed firm’s desired supply.  From this, firms will begin to 
   raise price.  Lastly as price rise the LM curve will shift back up and return to the original equilibrium 
   level and prices will be higher.  Namely prices will increase by the same proportion as the increased 
   money supply.
 - In real economies the nominal money supply and the price level always increase by some percentage.  
   The important fact is an increase that is above what is expected.
 - Classical Economic and money neutrality: according to the classical economist when the economy is in 
   disequilibrium the price level adjusts quickly so that monetary policy is ineffective.
 - Keynesians: believe that prices are slow to adjust.  Therefore when the economy is in disequilibrium, 
   instead of firms simple raising prices on supply they attempt to produce more, which is above and 
   beyond the full-employment output.  In the long-run prices and wage will adjust too, and the price 
   level will rise.

Exchange Rates: 
Nominal Exchange Rate: this is the exchange rate quoted in the paper.  It is the amount of domestic 
                       currency that is needed to buy foreign currency.  Most often the nominal exchange 
					   rate is quoted in terms of the domestic currency or how much foreign currency can 
					   be bought for one unit of domestic currency.  Lastly exchange rates are decided 
					   in foreign exchange markets.
Real Exchange Rate: this is the exchange rate that relates the amount of foreign goods that can be had with 
                    a given unit of domestic goods.  The real exchange rate is equal to the product of the 
					nominal exchange rate to the nominal price divided by the foreign price.
 - Purchasing Power Parity: this assumes that the goods in one country are identical to that of other countries 
                            (no monopolistic power) therefore the real exchange rate would be equal to one.  
							Therefore the nominal exchange rate would equal the ratio of the foreign price to 
							the domestic price of the one good.
 - Relative purchasing power parity: this formula build upon the assumptions of the PPP, in that the percentage 
                                     change in the nominal exchange rate should be equal to the difference of 
									 the foreign inflation to the domestic inflation. 

Real Exchange Rates and Net Exports: when a country’s real exchange rate fall the economic expectation is that 
                                     their net exports will rise.  This is due to the fact that importing cost 
									 more so the domestic nationals import less and that domestic goods are now 
									 cheaper in foreign countries so foreign nationals demand more and exports 
									 rise.  Therefore the difference of export to imports goes up with a 
									 depreciation of the real exchange rate.
									 
J Curve: this concept refers to the fact of slow adjustment to a change in the real exchange rate.  If say oil 
         prices go up then the real exchange rate has depreciated.  According to the previous analysis the 
		 expectation is that net exports will rise.  However, the J curve states that since the capital stock 
		 is slow to adjust, meaning it would take awhile for the domestic country to produce its own oil instead, 
		 the imports fall only slightly.  Meaning the total cost of imports goes up and therefore net exports fall 
		 with a deprecation of the real exchange rate.  Such cases could only happen when the foreign country has 
		 monopolistic power over a given good, which is just the case with oil.
		 
Exchange Rate Determination: exchange rates are determined by supply and demand analysis.  The exchange rate equals 
 where demand for the currency equals the supply of the currency.  
 - Demand for Currency: this is derived from foreigners wish to buy 
  - Domestic exports [Current Account]
  - Domestic Assets [Capital Account]
 - Supply of Currency: this is derived from domestics residents wish to buy
  - Foreign Imports [Current Account]
  - Foreign Assets [Capital Account]
Macroeconomic Determinant of the Exchange Rate
 Output (Income): If domestic income rises then domestic consumption goes up.  This increased consumption also means 
                  that the consumption of imports goes up.  In order to pay for the import the domestic residents 
				  supply more of the domestic currency.  More supply with constant demand means that the domestic 
				  currency will depreciate. In the case of foreign income rising, foreigners will demand more 
				  domestic currency and cause the domestic currency to appreciate. 
Real Interest Rate: with an increase in the real interest rate a country’s assets become more attractive.  Domestic 
                    nationals supply less domestic currency and foreign nationals demand more domestic currency this 
					causes the domestic currency to appreciate.  From this net exports fall since imports are now 
					cheaper for the domestic nationals and exports are more expensive to foreign nationals.

IS-LM Model of the Open Economy: in the open economy model only the IS curve changes both the LM and the FE line 
                                 remain the same in their derivations.
Open Economy IS Curve: this curve is derived from a new type of goods market equilibrium.  In an open economy the 
                       goods market is in equilibrium when the difference between desired national saving and desired 
					   national investment equal net exports or the current account.  The endogenous variable is still 
					   the interest rate.
 - S – I Curve: this is an upward sloping curve because, with output held constant, as the interest rate rises national 
                saving rises and national investment (both desired) falls.  Note, however, that the S – I curve can 
				be negative.
 - NX Line: this curves slopes downward, with constant output, as the interest rate rise the currency appreciates meaning 
            net exports falls. This line can also be a negative value.
 - Note that an equilibrium value for the goods market can have a negative value.  If this were the case it would mean 
   that desired investment is greater than desired savings and that net exports is negative meaning imports are greater 
   than exports.  
 - The IS curve is derived by letting output change which has an effect on both the S – I curve and the NX curve.  Namely, 
   as output increases desired national saving increases while desired national investment remains constant.  This causes 
   the S – I line to shift out (rightward).  When output increase the NX curve shifts inward because as domestic income 
   goes up then so does all domestic expenditures including imports.
   
 - With the S – I curve shifting outward and the NX curve shifting inward the market clearing interest rate definitely 
   falls as output increases.  Therefore the open economy IS line is downward sloping. 
   
Shift in an Open Economy IS Curve: all the factors that would shift a closed economy IS curve also shifts an open economy 
                                   IS curve.  However, there are other factors that effect an open economy IS curve.
 - Foreign Output: when foreign output goes up foreign income goes up meaning all foreign expenditure go up including 
                   consumption of imports.  This causes the domestic NX curve to shift upward which causes the entire 
				   open economy IS curve to shift upward.
 - Foreign Real Interest Rate: when the foreign real interest rate goes up demand for foreign currency increases and 
                               supply of foreign currency decreases meaning the foreign currency appreciates. This means 
							   that the domestic nation can now buy more foreign currency per unit domestic currency. 
							   This causes the domestic net exports to rise.  Again the NX curve shifts upward causing 
							   the IS curve to shift upward as well.
 - Demand for Domestic Goods: of course if this happens then net exports rise shifting the IS curve upward.
