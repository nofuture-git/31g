Basics with R
 #define a vector
 a <- c(1,3,2)
 b <- c(2,8,9)
 
 #assignment can work both ways
 c(1,3,2) -> a  
 c(2,8,9) -> b
 
 #multiple statement on single line are ; sep'ed
 c(1,3,2) -> a; b <- c(2,8,9)
 
 #transpose 
 t(a)

 
 #scalar multiplication
 7*a
 
 #sum of vectors
 a+b
 
 #inner product
 sum(a*b)
 
 #vector length (e.g |a|)
 sqrt(sum(a*a))
 
 #repeat 0,1 vector
 rep(0,5)
 rep(1,5)
 
 #orthogonal vector have inner product of zero
 v = c(0,5)
 w = c(3,0)
 sum(v*w)  #equals zero
 
 #define a matrix
 #df are read column-by-column 
 A <- matrix(c(1,3,2,2,8,9), ncol = 3)
 #set to read row-by-row
 B <- matrix(c(5, 8, 3, 4, 2, 7), ncol = 3, byrow = T)
  
 #scalar multiplication
 7*A
 
 #transpose matrix
 t(A)
 
 #matrix addition
 A + B
 
 #column-vector multiplication
 b <- c(5,8)
 A %*% a
 
 #matrix multiplication
 #A as r X c and B as c X t, AB is r X t matrix
 A <- matrix(c(1,3,2,2,8,9), ncol=2)
 B <- matrix(c(5,8,4,2), ncol = 2)

Points & Vectors
 - most basic 2D a point is two coords
 - three or more points are collinear when 
   they all lie on a single line
 - two points are collinear since it takes 
   two points to form a line.
 p = [p1,p2]
 q = p + v
 [q1,q2] = [p1,p2] + [v1,v2] = [p1 + v1, p2 + v2]
 v = q - p
 [v1,v2] = [q1,q2] - [p1,p2] = [q1 - p1, q2 - p2]
 
 - vector is a difference of two points
   which describes a direction and distance
  - the components of v is v1 and v2 which indicate
    a rise & run from point p
  - two vectors are equal if they have the same
    component values just as two points are equal
	if they have the same coords
  - a vectors components are called a 'tail' and 'head'
  
 - points and vectors are different geometric entities
  - distinguishing them it to achieve geometric constructs
    that are coordinate-independent.
  - coordinate-independent constructs are manipulations 
    applied to geometric objects that produce the same 
    result regardless of the location of the coordinate 
    origin.
  
 - in practice:
  - subtracting to points yields a vector
  - adding or subtracting two vectors yields another
    vector
  - multiplying by a scalar is called scaling.
    The result s*v adjusts the length by the scaling
	factor
	- the direction is unchanged if s is greater-than 0
	- the direction is reversed if s is less-than 0
  - adding a vector to a point yields another point

  - a 'well-defined' operation is one which is coordinate 
    independent
  - scaling a point (s*p) is not well-defined
  - scaling a vector (s*v) is well-defined
  - adding two points (p+q) is not well-defined since
    it is dependent on the coordinate origin
  - a vector-field is one where each point is 
    assigned to a vector 
  - moving a continuous field into a vector-field
    is called discretizing - taking some sample of
	points and assigning each a vector
----

----
Vector Length
 - may represent distance, velocity or acceleration
 - length of a vector is called magnitude
 - since a vector's components are the rise & run
   the vector's length may be assigned as the 
   hypotenuse of a right triangle
 - this is named the Euclidean norm  
   |V|^2 = v1^2 + v2^2
   |V| = sqrt(v1^2 + v2^2)
 - a normalized vector has a unit length of one
   |W| = 1
  - normalized vectors are also known as unit vectors
  - not every vector is a normalized one
 - to normalize a vector is divide each component by 
   Euclidean norm
   W = v/|V|
   
   - example, not a normalized vector
   v = [3,7]
  |V| = sqrt(3^2 + 7^2)
  |V| = 7.615773106
   W = [3/7.615773106, 7/7.615773106]
   W = [0.3939192986, 0.91914503]
   
  - example, a normalized vector
   v = [5,0]
  |V| = sqrt(5^2,0^2)
  |V| = 5
   W = [5/5, 0/5]
   W = [1, 0]
   
 - the distance between two points is the
   Euclidean norm of the vector of the two points 
   q = [-1,2]
   p = [1,0]
  q-p  = [-1-1, 2-0] = [-2,2]
 |q-p| = sqrt(-2^2 + 2^2)
 |q-p| = 2.828427125
----

----
Combining Points
 - although not well-defined there is a way to 
   combine two points
  -given two points p and q, v = q-p, t is a scaler
 r = p + t*v
 r = p + t*(q-p) 
 r = p + tq - tp
 r = p - tp + tq
 r = (1-t)*p + tq
      t = |r-p| / (|r-p| + |q-r|) 
  (1-t) = |q-r| / (|r-p| + |q-r|)
  
 - example
  p = [2,4], r = [6.5,7] q = [8,8]
  r = (1-t)*p + tq
  [6.5,7] = (1-t)*[2,4] + t*[8,8]
  
  |r-p| = |[6.5 - 2, 7 - 4]|
  |r-p| = |[4.5, 3]|
  |r-p| = sqrt(4.5^2 + 3^2)
  |r-p| = 5.408326913
  
  |q-r| = |[8 - 6.5, 8 - 7]|
  |q-r| = |[1.5, 1]|
  |q-r| = sqrt(1.5^2 + 1^2)
  |q-r| = 1.802775638
  
  |r-p| + |q-r| = 5.408326913 + 1.802775638
  |r-p| + |q-r| = 7.211102551
  
  t = |r-p| / (|r-p| + |q-r|) 
  t = 5.408326913 / 7.211102551
  t = 0.75
  
 (1-t) = |q-r| / (|r-p| + |q-r|) 
 (1-t) = 1.802775638 / 7.211102551
 (1-t) = 0.25

Dot Product
 - concerns the two vectors 
  - are they the same vector
  - are they perpendicular 
  - what angle to they form
 
 |v - w|^2 = |v|^2 + |w|^2
 (v1 - w1)^2 + (v2 - w2)^2 = (v1^2 + v2^2) + (w1^2 + w2^2)
  -binomial expansion
 (v1^2 - 2*v1*w1 + w1^2)+(v2^2 - 2*v2*w2 +w2^2) = (v1^2 + v2^2) + (w1^2 + w2^2)
 (v1^2 - 2*v1*w1 + w1^2)+(v2^2 - 2*v2*w2 +w2^2) - (v1^2 + v2^2) - (w1^2 + w2^2) = 0
  v1^2 - 2*v1*w1 + w1^2 + v2^2 - 2*v2*w2 +w2^2  + -v1^2 +  -v2^2 + -w1^2 + -w2^2 = 0
   (v1*w1) + (v2*w2) = 0
      v * w = 0
 
 - is then used to define the cosine of two vectors
        w

 -solve for the angle by
  cosθ = v*w / |v|*|w|
----

----
Orthogonal projection
 - the orthogonal project of w onto v is defined as
 
  u = ((v * w)/|v|^2) * v
 - using this the vector w can be decomposed into 
   two perpendicular vectors
  
  u┴ = w - ((v * w)/|v|^2) * v
----

----
Other vector rules
 - Cauchy-Schwartz inequality
 - used for the study of more genearl vector spaces
 (v * w)^2 <= |v|^2 * |w|^2
 
 - triangle inequality
 |v + w| <= |v| + |w|
 
 - barycentric coordinates 
  - interpreting vector v as the diff 
    between points q and p 
 v = q - p	
 ----

----
Lines defined
 - different ways to specify a line geometrically
  - two points on a single line
  - one point and one vector on a line
  - one point and one vector perpendicular to the line
 - likewise, there are different was to specify a line
   mathematically
  - parametric
  - implicit
  - explicit
  
 - Parametric equation of a line
  - where p ϵ E² and v ϵ R² (whatever that means)
  l(t) = p + tv  
   v = q - p (barycentric coords)
  l(t) = (1 - t)p + tq  (this form is aka linear interpolation)
  - can be used to find points on a line given two points
  
 - Implicit equation of a line
  a*x1 + b*x2 + c = 0
   a = a1
   b = a2
   c = a1*p1 - a2*p2
   
  - solve for a
  p <- t(c(2,2)); q <- t(c(6,4))
  v <- q - p
  # a = [-v2, v1]
  a <- t(c(-1*v[1,2], v[1,1]))
  #a = [-2,4]
   
  - solve for c
  c <- -1 * a[1,1] * p[1,1] - a[1,2] * p[1,2]
  #c = -4
   
  - implicit form is
   implicitForm <- function(x1,x2) -2*x1 + 4*x2 - 4
  - this can be used to determine if a point is on a line
   implicitForm(2,2) #0
  - to test equality this should because of floating point errors
  #d = (a1*x1 + a2*x2 + c) / |a|
  isOnLine <- function(x1,x2) (normalForm(x1, x2)) / vLen(a)
  
 - Explicit equation of a line
  x2 = ~a * x1 + ~b
  - where  ~a is -a/b and ~b = -c/b
  - this the classic form with intercept and slope
  - ~a is the slope (rise/run) 
   - slope is formally defined as tan(θ)
   - problem with explicit form is flat lines
     have and infinite slope
----

Line Equation conversion
 - Parametric to Implicit
 l: l(t) = p + tv        parametric
 l: a*x1 + bx2 + c = 0   implicit
   a = [-v2, v1]
   c = -(a1*p1 + a2*p2)
   
 - Implicit to Parametric 
 l: a*x1 + bx2 + c = 0   implicit
 l: l(t) = p + tv        parametric
   v = [b, -a]
   p = [-c/a,0] -or- [0,-c/b]
      choose by whichever is greatest
	   abs(a) > abs(b), choose [-c/a,0]
	   abs(a) < abs(b), choose [0,-c/b]
----

----
Distance of a Point to a Line
 - given any point (r) and line (l)
   how far is r from l
   
 d = (a * (r - p)) / |a|
 
 - implicit eq form
  l: 4 * x1 + 2 * x2 - 8
  r: [5,3]
  
  l <- c(4,2)
  c <- -8
  r <- c(5,3)
  
  d = (sum(l * r) + c) / vLen(l)
----

----
Foot of a given point
 - given some line (l) and some point (r)
   which point on (l) is closest to (r) 
   known as (q)

  t = (v * (r - p)) / (vLen(v))^2
  q = p + t * v
  
  - parameteric eq form
   l(t) = p + t * v
    l: = [0,1] + t * [0,2]
    r: [3,4]
   
  p <- c(0,1)
  v <- c(0,2)
  r <- c(3,4)
  
  t <- (v * (r -p)) / vLen(v)^2
  q <- p + t * v
